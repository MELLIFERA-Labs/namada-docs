# Namada Community DOCS

## What is the Namada Community?

The Namada community is composed of ecosystems, communities, researchers, builders, creators, advocates, users and everyday people – who want to see a future in which decentralized systems can serve as real alternatives to existing financial systems. To achieve this, protecting users’ personally identifiable information is paramount.

We are brought together by the Namada Vision of restoring the freedom to reveal. Together we make  data rights a reality by building open-source tools, operating protocols, teaching people about privacy, using privacy, and funding tools for shielding users’ sensitive data.
