# CB RPGF Round 1

The Namada protocol could not be built without public goods and the community wouldn’t be where it is today without the help of the early Community Builders – brought together by a shared mission of using, educating, and collaborating to build technology for user data protection. Namada’s native token is not only used for proof-of-stake and governance, but also to [align the incentives](https://namada.net/blog/namada-s-positive-sum-economics) of the community with the network.

The [Anoma Foundation](https://anoma.foundation/) has announced they will allocate 10,000,000 of Namada’s native token in the genesis block proposal to the selected recipients of the first Namada Community Builder RPGF Round – every active Community Builder member can be a potential recipient, dating back to the beginning of the community’s history. This includes early validators who have participated in previous testnets and have meaningfully worked to assist other validators in gaining access to, raising issues with, or triaging solutions for previous testnets.

## Voting process
For this RPGF round, the early PGF stewards and the Community Builders will use Coordinape. Your participation in the Community Builders program means that you have a voice in what is important and impactful to Namada. The results of this voting process will inform which Community Builders will receive an allocation for their efforts and the amount. Early PGF stewards will inform the Anoma Foundation about the results so they can be included in the genesis block proposal.

### How voting works
> Remember, to participate in voting, you must be an active Community Builder

1. As part of the onboarding process, CBs are added to the Community Builder Circle (CB Circle) on Coordinape by Early PGF Stewards using the ETH address submitted in the form 
    - Remember: this ETH address is **only** used to authenticate your access to Coordinape.
2. As soon as you’re part of the CB Circle on Coordinape, you can start logging your contributions to your profile. During this period, no voting will take place.
    - Before logging a contribution, see the [guidelines](https://namada.net/community/docs/community-builder-handbook#contributing).
    - Inactivity during the contribution period: A re-evaluation of the CB membership can be conducted (you [can lose your CB membership](https://namada.net/community/docs/community-builder-handbook#losing-cb-membership) during this period). This happens, though - if you haven’t submitted any contributions before the voting period begins.
3. Voting starts as soon as the 1-week Epoch begins. During this period:
    - Each CB member will receive a fixed amount of GIVE on Coordinape (aka points on the platform). This amount of GIVE is the same for every CB.
    - Note: if you haven’t submitted any work over the course of an Epoch, you’ll be pruned out of the CB circle and will not receive GIVE.
    - CBs will have 1 week to allocate their GIVE to other CB members based on their contributions.
    - In parallel, Early PGF stewards will also have 1 week allocate their GIVE to CB members.
4. Voting weights:
   - CBs will have 40%, while Early PGF stewards will have 60% of total voting weight.
   - The amount of GIVE distributed across CBs and the Early PGF stewards will reflect these weights.

5. End of Epoch and voting:
    - At the end of the epoch, the results will be published.
    - These results will determine the recipients and amounts.
    - The early PGF stewards will inform the Anoma Foundation on the final proposed recipients and respective allocations to be included in the genesis block proposal.
