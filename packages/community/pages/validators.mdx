# Validators

The development of Namada started in 2022, back then it went by the codename of “M1”. After months of development, throughout summer and fall we launched a series of [private testnets](https://github.com/anoma/namada-testnets/tree/main/namada-close-quarters-testnet-1) with the help of a handful of early validators who believed in the vision of bringing asset agnostic shielding. The community at this stage was composed by the core developers at Heliax and [the few validators](https://namada.net/blog/announcing-namada-public-testnets) (7 team members from Heliax and [11 validators](https://github.com/anoma/namada-testnets/tree/main/namada-close-quarters-testnet-5)) who joined and coordinated through the Validator Hangout on Element. The last private testnets ran until December 2022, the protocol version was `v0.11`.

In December 2022, the first [public testnet](https://namada.net/blog/announcing-namada-public-testnets) was launched with a few more validators joining forces ([29 in total](https://github.com/anoma/namada-testnets/tree/main/namada-public-testnet-1), with a few team-run nodes). Ever since, the core developers have published numerous protocol releases from `v0.12.0`, until the latest `v0.23.1` and more than 13 testnets launches/upgrades. The number of validators grew a lot, a total of [253 validators](https://github.com/anoma/namada-testnets/tree/main/namada-public-testnet-13) submitted their genesis keys for testnet 13.

Every testnet followed the same decentralized launch process as practice for mainnet, where a protocol version and a genesis proposal is published, and it is entirely up to the validators whether the network goes live or not.
