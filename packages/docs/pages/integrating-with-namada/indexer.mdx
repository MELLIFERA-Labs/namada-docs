# Namada Indexers

There are two actively maintained indexers built for Namada -- *Undexer* and *namada-indexer*.

## Undexer

[Undexer](https://github.com/hackbg/undexer) is a community-led project developed by the Mandragora and HackBG teams. It indexes transaction details, validator set updates, 
governance proposals and more, and serves the indexed data via a REST api.  

Detailed installation and usage instructions for *Undexer* can be found on the project's [repo](https://github.com/hackbg/undexer).

## Namada-Indexer

The [namada-indexer](https://github.com/anoma/namada-indexer) crawls a Namada blockchain to map details such as transactions, validator set updates, POS rewards, 
governance proposals and more. It stores the results in a Postgres database where it can be queried via a REST api.  

*Namada-indexer* was created to power the [Namadillo](./interface.mdx) interface; however it can be generally useful for any application that needs to query historical data 
or perform analytics over the blockchain.  

The remainder of this page will detail the process of configuring, running, and querying *namada-indexer*.

## Setting up

The *namada-indexer* source code can be found [here](https://github.com/anoma/namada-indexer).  

It's recommended to use [Docker/Docker Compose](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) to run the indexer.

### Prerequisites
- *(required)*: an available Namada RPC node
- *(required)*: [Docker and Docker Compose](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
- *(optional but recommended)*: [Just](https://github.com/casey/just) -- see the project's README for installation instructions for your system

### RPC configuration
To configure your RPC node to serve historical data to the indexer, you will need to open its `config.toml` file (located in `~/.local/share/namada/$CHAIN_ID` by default) 
and find the setting `storage_read_past_height_limit`. Change the default value of `3600` to an appropriately high number.  

If you see the following error in your logs when running the indexer, it indicates that you have this value configured too low:
```
Info log: RPC error: Cannot query more than 3600 blocks in the past (configured via `shell.storage_read_past_height_limit`)., error code: 1
```

## Running the indexer
The following steps will help you configure and run *namada-indexer*.
<Steps>
### Clone repo
Begin by cloning the indexer repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/anoma/namada-indexer.git
cd namada-indexer
```

### Set environment variables
The indexer configuration is stored in its `.env` file, found in the base directory of the repo. Refer to `.env_sample` to see which values can be set.  

Create that file now:
```
cp .env_sample .env
```

It will have the following default values:
```
DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:password@postgres:5432/namada-indexer
TENDERMINT_URL=http://host.docker.internal:27657
CACHE_URL=redis://dragonfly:6379
WEBSERVER_PORT=5000
```

Change the value of `TENDERMINT_URL` to the url of your RPC node.

### (Recommended) Change Postgres username and password
The default username and password (`postgres` and `password` respectively) will work for local development, however they should be changed if your indexer will be publicly accessible.  

First, open the file `docker-compose-db.yml` and change the default values to something more secure:
```
environment:
  POSTGRES_PASSWORD: NEW_PASSWORD
  POSTGRES_USER: NEW_USERNAME
  PGUSER: NEW_USERNAME
  POSTGRES_DB: namada-indexer
```

Then, update the Postgres url in your `.env` file with the new values.  

The schema for the url is `postgres://{user_name}:{password}@{host}:{port}/{database_name}`
```
DATABASE_URL=postgres://NEW_USERNAME:NEW_PASSWORD@postgres:5432/namada-indexer
```

### Build the containers
Build the indexer containers by running:
```
docker compose build
```

Instead of building yourself, you can check the repo's [container registry](https://github.com/anoma/namada-indexer/pkgs/container/namada-indexer) for 
recent images.

### Start the indexer
Start all indexer containers with this command:
```
just docker-up
```
You can expect to see some database connection errors in the logs during the time the database is being initialized -- these are normal and will resolve within a couple minutes.
<Callout type="info">
Assuming you want to keep the indexer running persistently in the background, you will likely want to perform this step using something like `screen` or `tmux`.  

*Eg.* In Ubuntu, using `screen`:
1. Start a new screen session: `screen -S indexer`
2. Start the indexer: `just docker-up`
3. Detach from the session, allowing it to run in the background: Press `Ctrl+A` and then `d`
4. To re-attach to the session at a later time: `screen -d -r indexer`
</Callout>
Stop the indexer with `Ctrl+c`. Remove all associated data with `docker compose down --volumes`.
</Steps>

## REST API
Once the indexer has been started, the `webserver` container will serve requests at the port given by `WEBSERVER_PORT` in the `.env` file.  

Available endpoints are documented in the `swagger.yml` file inside the repo.  

*Eg.* to query the latest indexed block:
```
curl localhost:5000/api/v1/chain/block/latest

# response
{"block":"163445"}
```

## Querying the database
You can also query the Postgres database directly.  

*Eg.* to perform a simple query using `pgcli` on Ubuntu:
<Steps>
### Install `pgcli`
```
sudo apt install pgcli
```
### Connect to the database
(If you changed your Postgres username and/or password above, use the updated values.)
```
pgcli postgres://postgres:password@localhost:5435/namada-indexer
```
### Run a query
*Eg.* Find a wrapper transaction by its hash:
```
SELECT * FROM wrapper_transactions WHERE id = 'cece56db36322f9b0728a0f2e127ef33c410a9fab74e2b9e135f97903c6c2c4e';
```
</Steps>

If you prefer to use a GUI, there are many free options available such as [Beekeeper Studio](https://www.beekeeperstudio.io/get-community) and [pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/download/).
