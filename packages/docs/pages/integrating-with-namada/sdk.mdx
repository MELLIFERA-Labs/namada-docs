# The Namada SDK

The Namada software development kit (SDK) can be found in the `namada` repo under the path [`namada/crates/sdk`](https://github.com/anoma/namada/tree/main/crates/sdk). 
The SDK is written in Rust and can be used to interact with the Namada blockchain by constructing transactions, signing them, and submitting them to the network.

This section explains some basic operations using the SDK with example code.
