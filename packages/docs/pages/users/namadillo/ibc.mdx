# IBC Transfers with Namadillo

<Callout type='info'>
Namada mainnet will launch with most functionality aside from staking and governance disabled, gradually enabling features in stages (via governance proposals) over the first 
few weeks. Therefore, some sections of Namadillo will not be accessible immediately after launch until its respective functionality has been activated on mainnet.  

Until then, you can experiment with all aspects of Namadillo on [testnet](../networks/testnets.mdx).

You can connect your [Keplr wallet](https://www.keplr.app/) with Namadillo to transfer assets in and out of Namada to **Cosmos SDK** chains, 
via IBC. Namadillo offers both transparent and shielded IBC transfers.

- **Transparent IBC transfers:** these are transfers between (either to or from) a transparent (`tnam...`) Namada address and another chain. After receiving 
assets to your transparent address, they will be added to your transparent balance. You can (optionally) shield them at a later time. But as always, keep in 
mind that a third party can view all balances and transactions of any transparent address at any point in the chain's history.
- **Shielded IBC transfers:** these are transfers between (either to or from) a shielded (`znam...`) Namada address and another chain. 
These transfers move immediately to/from your shielded balance without needing to pass through your transparent address first. This 
reduces the chances of accidentally leaking information which could potentially be used by others to make inferences about your on-chain activity.
