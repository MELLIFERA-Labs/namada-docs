# Shielded IBC

You can send assets to another IBC compliant chain, such as a Cosmos SDK chain or another Namada chain, using the
`ibc-transfer` command in `namadac`.

This section covers sending assets to and from a shielded ( `znam` ) address.

## Prerequisites

- An active IBC connection has been created and maintained between the two chains by operators running relayer 
software such as [Hermes](https://github.com/heliaxdev/hermes). 
- You will need to know the corresponding channel id

## IBC transfer to a shielded address
<Callout>
Previous versions of Namada required a two-step process to make IBC transfers to a shielded address: first a MASP proof was generated using the 
`ibc-gen-shielded` command, and this proof was included in the `memo` field of the transfer.  

It is no longer necessary to manually generate the MASP proof, and the `ibc-gen-shielded` command has been removed.

IBC transfers to a shielded address work similarly to those for a [tranparent address](./transparent-ibc.mdx), 
the only difference being that we provide for `$RECV_ADDRESS` a shielded (`znam`) address instead of a transparent (`tnam`) one:

```bash copy
namadac ibc-transfer \
  --source $SOURCE_ADDRESS \
  --receiver $RECEIVER_PAYMENT_ADDRESS \
  --token $TOKEN \
  --amount $AMOUNT \
  --channel-id $CHANNEL_ID
```
  
Or, when sending from a Cosmos Sdk chain:

```bash copy
gaiad tx ibc-transfer transfer \
  $CHANNEL_ID \
  $RECEIVER_PAYMENT_ADDRESS \
  ${AMOUNT}${IBC_TOKEN_ADDRESS} \
  --from $COSMOS_ALIAS \
  --node $COSMOS_RPC_ENDPOINT \
  --fees 5000uatom
```

## IBC transfer from a shielded address
You can also send IBC transfers from a shielded address, by providing the associated spending key as the source:
```bash copy
namadac ibc-transfer \
  --source $SOURCE_SPEND_KEY \
  --receiver $RECV_ADDRESS \
  --token $TOKEN \
  --amount $AMOUNT \
  --channel-id $CHANNEL_ID \
  --gas-payer $IMPLICIT_ADDRESS
```
<Callout>
When sending any transaction from a shielded address, you must also provide an implicit address which you control with enough funds to cover gas costs.
