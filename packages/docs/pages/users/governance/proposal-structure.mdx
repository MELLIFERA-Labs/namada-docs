# Creating a proposal

To create a governance proposal, a user must have an address on-chain, a balance of more than `min_proposal_fund` NAM tokens, and a json file containing the proposal details and data.

To get your address that you will need to use, you can look in the wallet using your account alias (`my-new-acc` in this example):

```shell copy
namada wallet find --alias `my-new-acc`
```

Now, we need to create a json file `proposal.json` holding the content of our proposal. Copy the below text into a json file.

```json
{
    "proposal": {
        "content": {
            "title": "Text",
            "authors": "Text",
            "discussions-to": "URL",
            "created": "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ",
            "license": "<insert-license>",
            "abstract": "Text",
            "motivation": "Text",
            "details": "Text",
            "requires": "Number"
        },
        "author": "tnam-author-address",
        "voting_start_epoch": <Number>,
        "voting_end_epoch": <Number>,
        "activation_epoch": <Number>
    },
    "data": "TODO-ADD-DATA-IF-NEEDED" // optional field to contain serialized wasm code
}
```

Most of the fields within `"content"` are self-explanatory.
The `requires` field references an id in quotations of another proposal that must be passed before this proposal can be executed (i.e. `requires: "2"` mandates that proposal 2 must pass for this proposal to pass).
The `created` field must contain the creation time in the format `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`.


A proposal author should manually set the following fields in the `proposal.json`:

- `author`: the `tnam` address of `my-new-acc`;
- `voting_start_epoch`: a future epoch in which you want the voting to begin.
- `voting_end_epoch`: an epoch that is at least `min_proposal_voting_period` epochs further into the future than `voting_start_epoch` at which point no more votes are accepted.
- `activation_epoch`: an epoch that is at least `min_proposal_grace_epochs` epochs further into the future than `voting_end_epoch`, at which any associated WASM code will be executed.

The `data` field and its contents are dependent on the [type of proposal](./proposal-types.mdx) being submitted.
In a default proposal, data is optional, but if included then it is a vector of bytes corresponding to WASM code.
In a PGF-related proposal, the data contents take another form.
