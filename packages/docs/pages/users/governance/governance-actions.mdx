# Governance actions

## Submitting the proposal
While in the same directory as your final `proposal.json` file, you can submit the proposal with:

**For a default proposal:**

```shell copy
namada client init-proposal --data-path proposal.json 
```

**For non-default proposals:**

One of the flags `--pgf-stewards`, `--pgf-funding`, `--eth` must be specified. For example, for a PGF steward proposal:

```shell copy
namada client init-proposal --pgf-stewards --data-path proposal.json
```

## Query the proposal
If the submitted transaction was accepted, the user can query the proposal with its proposal ID:

```shell copy
namada client query-proposal --proposal-id $ID
```

Additionally, the user can query some of the most recent proposals with:

```shell copy
namada client query-proposal
```

## Vote on a proposal

Only delegators and validators can vote on proposals. A delegator or validator can send a vote with the following command:

```shell copy
namada client vote-proposal \
    --proposal-id $ID \
    --vote yay \
    --address $YOUR_ADDRESS
```
where `--vote` can be either `yay`, `nay` or `abstain`.

<Callout type="info">
The `--address` flag needs to be the address of the delegator or validator that is voting. You may also use the `--gas-payer` flag to specify the address of the account that will pay for the gas.
</Callout>


## Check the result

As soon as the ledger reaches the epoch defined in the json as `voting_end_epoch`, no more votes will be accepted.
At the beginning of the `activation_epoch`, the votes are tallied.
If the proposal passes, the code defined in `proposal_code` json field will be executed at this time.

You can use the following commands to check the status of a proposal:

```shell copy
namada client query-proposal --proposal-id $ID
```

or to just check the result:

```shell copy
namada client query-proposal-result --proposal-id $ID
```

<Callout type="info">
If the proposal has not passed, it will be rejected, and the code will not be executed.

Another important note is that the voting period differs between validators and non-validators. The validators have a shorter voting period than the delegators. This is to ensure that the non-validators have enough time to vote on the proposals (so that the validators cannot vote in the last block against the non-validators preference). See the specs for more information.
</Callout>

### Tally types
The governance mechanism defines different criteria depending on proposal type in order for the proposal to pass:

**Default proposals** require at least 2/3 of the total active voting power to have voted AND the `yay` voting power must be at least 2/3 of the combined `yay + nay` voting power.

**PGF steward proposals** require at least 1/3 of the total active voting power to have voted AND the `yay` voting power must be larger than the `nay` voting power.

**Funding proposals** are tallied differently depending on if the proposal author is a PGF steward:
- Non-steward: the funding proposal is tallied in the same way as the PGF steward proposal (above).  
- Steward: the proposal can pass without any votes at all. However, the network can veto the proposal if 1/3 of the total active voting power votes, and the `nay` votes are larger than the `yay` votes.
In other words, the proposal passes if less than 1/3 of the total voting power votes OR there are more `yay` votes than `nay` votes.

## Submit a governance proposal with wasm code attached

First you will need a valid `.wasm` file. You then need to read this file into a vector of bytes. This can be done with the following small python script:

```python
with open(wasm_file_path, "rb") as f:
    byte_vec = list(f.read())
print(str(byte_vec))
```

The output can then be copied into the `data` field of the proposal json. E.g `"data": [1,255,3,4,5,182,7,81,90,10]`.

Additionally, there is a script in the namada repo called [`add_proposal_wasm_code.py`](https://github.com/anoma/namada/blob/main/scripts/add_proposal_wasm_code.py) that can be used to add the wasm data to a proposal template like `template_proposal.json` (LINK TO THIS TOO!):

```shell copy
python3 add_proposal_wasm_code.py --proposal-path $JSON_FILE --wasm-path $$WASM_FILE
```

This command will add the wasm data to the `$JSON_FILE`.

When submitting this proposal, it is likely that the gas requirement will be large. Therefore, it is recommended to supply at least the `--gas-limit` flag.

```shell copy
namadac init-proposal --data-path proposal.json --gas-limit 500000
```

<Callout type="info">
Hint: use the `--dry-run` feature to figure out how much gas will be needed and use `namadac query-protocol-paramters` to see the current minimum gas price.
