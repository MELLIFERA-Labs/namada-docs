# Governance actions

## Submitting the proposal
While in the same directory as your final `proposal.json` file, you can submit the proposal with:

**For a default proposal:**

```shell copy
namada client init-proposal --data-path proposal.json 
```

**For non-default proposals:**

One of the flags `--pgf-stewards`, `--pgf-funding`, `--eth` must be specified. For example, for a PGF steward proposal:

```shell copy
namada client init-proposal --pgf-stewards --data-path proposal.json
```

## Query the proposal
If the submitted transaction was accepted, the user can query all the proposals with:

```shell copy
namada client query-proposal
```

or a single proposal with

```shell copy
namada client query-proposal --proposal-id $ID
```

where `$ID` is the proposal id.

## Vote on a proposal

Only delegators and validators can vote on proposals. A delegator or validator can send a vote with the following command:

```shell copy
namada client vote-proposal \
    --proposal-id $ID \
    --vote yay \
    --address $YOUR_ADDRESS
```
where `--vote` can be either `yay`, `nay` or `abstain`.

<Callout type="info">
The `--address` flag needs to be the address of the delegator or validator that is voting. You may also use the `--gas-payer` flag to specify the address of the account that will pay for the gas.
</Callout>


## Check the result

As soon as the ledger reaches the epoch defined in the json as `voting_end_epoch`, no more votes will be accepted.
The code defined in `proposal_code` json field will be executed at the beginning of `activation_epoch` epoch. You can use the following commands to check the status of a proposal:

```shell copy
namada client query-proposal --proposal-id $ID
```

or to just check the result:

```shell copy
namada client query-proposal-result --proposal-id $ID
```

<Callout type="info">
It is important to note that the proposal will only be executed at the start of the `activation_epoch` epoch if it has passed. If it has not passed, the proposal will be rejected and the code will not be executed.

Another important note is that the voting period differs between validators and non-validators. The validators have a shorter voting period than the delegators. This is defined in the `parameters.toml`. This is to ensure that the non-validators have enough time to vote on the proposals (so that the validators cannot vote in the last block against the non-validators preference). See the specs for more information.

## Submit a governance proposal with wasm code attached (advanced)

First you will need a valid `.wasm` file. You then need to read this file into a vector of bytes. This can be done with the following small python script:

```python
with open(wasm_file_path, "rb") as f:
    byte_vec = list(f.read())
print(str(byte_vec))
```

The output can then be copied into the `data` field of the proposal json. E.g `"data": [1,255,3,4,5,182,7,81,90,10]`.

Additionally, there is a script in the namada repo called `add_proposal_wasm_code.py` (TODO: link to this when merged!!) that can be used to add the wasm data to a proposal template like `template_proposal.json` (LINK TO THIS TOO!):

```shell copy
python3 add_proposal_wasm_code.py --proposal-path $JSON_FILE --wasm-path $$WASM_FILE
```

This command will add the wasm data to the `$JSON_FILE`.

When submitting this proposal, it is likely that the gas requirement will be large. Therefore, it is recommended to supply at least the `--gas-limit` flag.

```shell copy
namadac init-proposal --data-path proposal.json --gas-limit 500000
```

<Callout type="info">
Hint: use the `--dry-run` feature to figure out how much gas will be needed and use `namadac query-protocol-paramters` to see the current minimum gas price.
