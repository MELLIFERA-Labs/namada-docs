# Types of governance proposals

There are three types of governance proposals: default, PGF, and Steward. Below, the differences are described by showing what the `data` field in the governance proposal typically looks like.

## Default Proposal 

The data field for default proposals is optional. If a proposal has code attached that is intended to execute in the state machine (such as changing the value of a protocol parameter), then the code must be compiled to WASM and then encoded into bytes, which are provided as the input to the data field.

```json
"data" : [1,255,3,4,5,182,7,81,90,10] # a vector of bytes
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="">
In order to read the path to bytes, one can use a simple python script.
```python
with open(file_path, "rb") as f:
    byte_vec = f.read()
print(byte_vec)
```

Additionally, the namada github repository contains a script (TODO: link when https://github.com/anoma/namada/pull/3471 is merged!) that attaches any wasm code to a proposal json file.

## Steward Proposal

A steward proposal is used to propose the addition or removal of an address from the list of PGF stewards, which are detailed [here](../public-goods-funding/electing.mdx).

The data field for steward proposals is a **list** of actions to be taken. 
The actions can be either `add` or `remove` and the address is the address of 
the steward to be added or removed. In this way you can propose multiple add/remove actions at once.

```json
"data" : {
    "add": "tnam1qql6qme020vw7pfw4ruavrwxujf9lf8z75v90c8q",
    "remove": ["tnam1qql6qme020vw7pfw4ruavrwxujf9lf8z75vaaaaa", "tnam1qql6qme020vw7pfw4ruavrwxujf9lf8z75vbbbbb"]
}
```

## PGF Proposal

The data field for PGF proposals contains both continuous and retroactive PGF funding actions. 
Within each action, the user can include multiple payments in the form of a vector. 
Within each payment, the target field contains the address of the recipient as well 
as the amount of NAM that they will receive. For continuous PGF funding, the amount 
specified will be sent at the end of each epoch. There is also the option to remove a 
recipient from the continuous PGF funding, by specifying an already existing continuous 
funding payment, and then setting the amount to "0". For retroactive PGF funding, 
the amount specified will be sent upon execution of the proposal at the beginning of the `activation_epoch`.

```json
"data" :
    {
        "continuous" : [
            {
                "Internal": 
                    {
                        "amount": "1337",
                        "target": "tnam1q9rxk49a7y6fp8h5qwz47d6jhml0km2w2y7emqyz"
                        
                    }
        }
        ],
        "retro" : [
            {
                "Internal": 
                    { 
                        "amount": "1337",
                        "target": "tnam1q9rxk49a7y6fp8h5qwz47d6jhml0km2w2y7emqyz"
                    }
            }
        ]
    }
```



#### IBC PGF proposals

For a PGF proposal that is to be executed on an IBC chain, the `"Internal"` data structure will be substituted with "IBC" and have the following contents:

```json
"IBC": 
    {
        
        "amount": "1337",
        "target": "tnam1q9rxk49a7y6fp8h5qwz47d6jhml0km2w2y7emqyz",
        "port_id": "<port-id>",
        "channel_id": "<channel-id>"
    }
```
