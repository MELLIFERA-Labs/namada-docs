# Off-chain proposals

If for any reason issuing an on-chain proposal is not adequate to your needs, you still have the option to create an off-chain proposal. An off-chain proposal is intended for proposals that do not require any on-chain code execution. The proposal would be distributed on some third-party channel (e.g., a forum) and the voting would be done off-chain. The result of the voting would be computed off-chain and then submitted to the ledger.

## Create proposal

### The proposal file

For offline proposals, the structure of the `proposal.json` file is as follows:

```json
"content": {
                "title": "<Title>",
                "authors": "<email>",
                "discussions-to": "<forum-link>",
                "created": "<Timestamp in format YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ>",
                "license": "<Licences>",
                "abstract": "<Abstract>",
                "motivation": "<Motivation>",
                "details": "<Details>",
                "requires": "<preceding-proposal-id-that-must-pass>",
            },
"author": "<author-address>",
"tally_epoch": 1337,
```

<Callout type="info">
The `tally_epoch` is the block height at which the tally was computed. This is any integer before the current epoch. Since the tallying should occur before it is submitted.
</Callout>

```shell copy
namada client init-proposal \
    --data-path proposal.json \
    --signing-keys your-signing-keys-for-author \
    --offline
```

This command will create a `proposal` file same directory where the command was launched.

<Callout type="info">
If you would like the proposal to be created in a different directory, you can use the `--output-folder-path` flag to specify the directory. The directory must already exist, however.
It is also essential that you provide the `--signing-keys` argument to sign the proposal. As of `v0.31.2`, the `--signing-keys` is optional but it is not possible to sign the proposal after it has been created.
</Callout>

## Vote on proposal

To vote on an offline proposal use the following command:

```shell copy
namada client vote-proposal --data-path proposal \
    --vote yay \
    --signing-keys your-signing-keys-for-voter \
    --address your-established-account \
    --offline
```

## Tally off-chain proposal

To compute the tally for an offline proposal we need to collect

- `proposal` file (must have this name)
- all the `proposal-vote-${address}` files

All those files will have to be in a folder (lets call it `offline-proposal`).

Now you can use the following command:

```shell copy
namada client query-proposal-result \
    --offline \
    --data-path `offline-proposal`
```

which will tell you the proposal result.

## Submit off-chain proposal

The community may decide to post data of their off-chain voting to another censorship resistant blockchain to preserve the decision reached by social consensus.
