# An Introduction to Namada addresses and keys

Namada addresses and keys can be one of either *transparent* or *shielded*.
The type is indicated by the first character in the address or key string - *t* for transparent and *z* for shielded.

**A quick rundown of all the different keys and addresses in Namada, indexed by their prefix:**
- `tnam`: a transparent address whose balance and transactions are public
- `tpknam`: a transparent public key used to verify signed txs - the `tnam` address is deterministically derived from this key
- `zsknam`: a shielded spending key - solely gives a user the power to send tokens from a shielded account
- `zvknam`: a shielded viewing key - solely gives a user the ability to view token balances from a shielded account
- `znam`: a shielded payment address - solely used as a target address to receive funds into a shielded account

More details on each of these addresses and keys is provided below.

## Transparent accounts
A transparent account consists of an address and one or more keypairs.
The account can be generated from either a seed phrase or a raw private key, which is typically a string of hex-encoded bytes.

There are two different types of transparent addresses, *implicit* and *established*.
All transparent addresses start with the string `tnam`, and all can hold token balances.

#### Implicit account
The simplest account type, an implicit address is derived from a single keypair.
Particularly, one obtains the implicit address by hashing the public key of the keypair and encoding the first 20 bytes with bech32m.

An implicit address and its associated parent keypair are used to authorize (sign for) transactions and pay fees.

More details are found [here](./transparent-accounts/implicit-accounts.mdx).

#### Established address
An established address can only be initialized with an on-chain transaction.
One or more cryptographic keys (implicit accounts) are used to create and sign for the established account.
In general, all multisignature accounts have an established address.

More details are found [here](./transparent-accounts/established-accounts.mdx).

## Shielded accounts
Shielded accounts are composed of a cryptographic keypair (the spending and viewing key) and one or more payment addresses.
There can be many payment addresses associated with a single shielded account.

More details on generating and using shielded keys can be found [here](./shielded-accounts/masp-keys.mdx).

#### Spending key
Starts with `zsknam` and authorizes a user to send tokens from a single shielded account.
This is analagous to the private key in the transparent case: the viewing key and payment addresses are derived from this key, so holding it allows full control over the shielded address.

The shielded account can be imported to the CLI wallet either from the raw spending key itself or from a seed phrase that is used to generate the spending key:
```
# From raw spending key
namadaw add --alias $ALIAS --value zsknam... 
 
# From seed
namadaw derive --alias $ALIAS --shielded # then will prompt user for seed phrase
```

#### Viewing key
Starts with `zvknam` and allows a user to view incoming and outgoing balances of a single shielded account and thus the token balances of the account at any given time.
This key does not authorize the user to spend balances.

#### Payment address
Starts with `znam` and is a public-facing address that can be shared with others in order to receive funds to a single shielded account.

A very large number of different payment addresses can be generated for the same shielded account.
Though the payment address is not visible on-chain from a transaction, using a new payment address for receiving funds from various counterparties is an option and can be advantageous from a privacy perspective.

A random payment address can be generated at the CLI with:
```
namadaw gen-payment-addr --alias $ALIAS --key $SHIELDED_SPENDING_KEY
```
