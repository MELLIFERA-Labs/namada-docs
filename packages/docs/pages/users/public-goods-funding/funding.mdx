# Proposing funding
Namada has two different types of public goods funding: continuous and retroative.

Recipients of continuous PGF receive tokens at the beginning of every epoch when inflation is minted.

Recipients of retroactive PGF receive tokens in a one-time transfer upon the successful execution of such a governance proposal, which also would occur at the beginning of an epoch.

In both cases of PGF, the recipient addresses can be either native Namada addresses or addresses on other IBC-compatible blockchains that have open channels with Namada.

## Submitting the funding proposal

A funding proposal can be submitted with the following CLI command:

```shell copy
namada client init-proposal \
    --pgf-funding \
    --data-path funding_proposal.json
```

The structure of `funding_proposal.json` is demonstrated with the following example:

```json
{
    "proposal": {
        "content": {
            "title": "Fund Jonny's cryptography PhD",
            "authors": "stewie@heliax.dev",
            "discussions-to": "forum.namada.net/t/jonny-cryptography/1",
            "created": "2024-01-01T00:00:01Z",
            "license": "MIT",
            "abstract": "Fund Jonny's cryptography PhD focusing on elliptic curves.",
            "motivation": "Jonny is the world's most promising cryptography prodigy.",
            "details": "It is important for humanity to support Jonny in his cryptography research."
        },
        "author": "tnam1qp326qxmkncgwavskar9lfwm68x04vu8sg80crm4",
        "voting_start_epoch": 3,
        "voting_end_epoch": 6,
        "activation_epoch": 12
    },
    "data": {
        "continuous": [
            {
                "Internal": {
                    "amount": "1000",
                    "target": "tnam1qp326qxmkncgwavskar9lfwm68x04vu8sg80aaaa"
                }
            }
        ],
        "retro": [
            {
                "Internal": {
                    "amount": "1500",
                    "target": "tnam1qp326qxmkncgwavskar9lfwm68x04vu8sg80bbbb"
                }
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

In the `"data"` section, both the `"continuous"` and `"retro"` fields contain a list of PGF targets.
The `"Internal"` keyword is used to indicate on-chain funding in the native token, whereas for funding over IBC to another chain, the `"IBC"` keyword would be used.
The attributes of an `"IBC"` object look like [this](../governance/proposal-types.mdx#ibc-pgf-proposals).

The value in the `"amount"` attribute is the raw token amount in that token's denomination.
So in the example above for a PGF funding in the native NAM token, the amount `1000` corresponds to `0.001 NAM`, since the Namada token denomination is `6`.

## Voting on the funding proposal
Voting on the funding proposal is done the same way as any other normal proposal, as described [here](../governance/governance-actions.mdx#vote-on-a-proposal).

If a funding proposal was submitted by a PGF steward, then voting on the proposal is not needed, as a steward funding proposal requires no `yay` votes to pass.
However, this kind of funding proposal can be vetoed by the community if the proposal receives more `nay` votes than `1/3` of the total active voting power.
Additionally, if the proposal receives at least as many `nay` votes as `2/3` of the total active voting power, then the steward account will be removed from the set of PGF stewards.
