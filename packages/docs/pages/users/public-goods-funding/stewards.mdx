# Stewards

A public goods steward can consist of an arbitrary number of people or can be a single person.
The only requirement is that the steward's multisignature account is elected by the community through a governance proposal.

For this reason, the first step to becoming a steward is to create a multisignature account. 
This can be done using the commands found in the [multisignature documentation](../transparent-accounts/multisignature.mdx). 

No more than `maximum_number_of_stewards` are allowed to exist at any given time; this parameter that controls the upper bound on stewards can be changed via governance.

## Becoming a steward
Once the multisig account is created, the steward can submit a governance proposal to nominate themselves for election as a steward.
A steward proposal to elect a multisig account may only be submitted by that same account.

### Submitting a steward governance proposal
A special governance proposal must be submitted in order to elect a steward. This is done with the following command:

```shell copy
namadac init-proposal \
        --pgf-stewards \
        --data-path $PATH_TO/steward_proposal.json
```
where `$PATH_TO/steward_proposal.json` is the path to the `steward_proposal.json` file.

The structure of the proposal `steward_proposal.json` looks like a default proposal but with an altered `"data"` section:

```json
{
    "proposal" :{
        "content": {
            "title": "Stewie for Steward",
            "authors": "stewie@heliax.dev",
            "discussions-to": "forum.namada.net/t/stewies-manifesto/1",
            "created": "2024-01-01T00:00:01Z",
            "license": "MIT",
            "abstract": "Stewie is an expert in zero-knowledge cryptography that would like to identify influential cryptographers to receive funding to continue their work.",
            "motivation": "Funding cryptography research will help Namada and other blockchain projects innovate and flourish.",
            "details": "We will describe here certain areas of ZK research that should receive funding."
        },
        "author": "atestatest1v4ehgw36g4pyg3j9x3qnjd3cxgmyz3fk8qcrys3hxdp5xwfnx3zyxsj9xgunxsfjg5u5xvzyzrrqtn",
        "voting_start_epoch": 3,
        "voting_end_epoch": 6,
        "activation_epoch": 12
    },
    "data" : {
        "add" : "atestatest1v4ehgw36g4pyg3j9x3qnjd3cxgmyz3fk8qcrys3hxdp5xwfnx3zyxsj9xgunxsfjg5u5xvzyzrrqtn",
        "remove": []
    }    
}
```

The `"data"` field contains the structure that allows either the addition or removal of 
a multisignature account from the list of stewards. In this case, the `"action"` is `"add"`, 
and the `"address"` is the address of the multisignature account that will be elected as a steward. 
In this case, the proposal does not call to remove any stewards, and so this field is an empty list `[]`.
A steward proposal may propose to remove more than one steward at a time.

In the motivation and abstract field, it is important to make clear what type of 
public goods funding the steward will be focusing on. 
The *areas of public goods funding* can be found in the 
[public goods funding specs](https://specs.namada.net/modules/governance/public-goods-funding.html#funding-focuses).

### Becoming elected

Once the proposal is submitted, it will be voted on by the community (see [voting](./voting.mdx)) like any other governance proposal.

Once a multisignature account is elected (which occurs at the beginning of the `activation_epoch`), it will be able to submit proposals to the public goods funding pool (see [submitting proposals](./proposing.mdx#proposing-funding)).

## Removing stewards

There are three ways that a steward can lose their stewardship:

#### 1. Resign as a steward
A steward account may resign their position at any point. Through the CLI it can be done with the command:

```shell copy
namadac resign-steward --steward $STEWARD_ADDRESS
```

#### 2. Funding proposal veto with removal
If a steward submits a funding proposal that receives at least as many `nay` votes as `2/3` of the total active voting power, then the steward is immediately removed in addition to the veto of the proposal.

#### 3. Removal through a governance proposal
A steward may be removed by a steward governance proposal as described [above](./stewards.mdx#submitting-a-steward-governance-proposal).
For removal, the `"remove"` list within the `"data"` field of the json file would contain the relevant steward address.

## Steward inflation
A PGF steward also receives inflationary NAM tokens at the beginning of every epoch.
The steward inflation rate is a constant parameter `stewards_inflation_rate` that can be changed via governance.

Each PGF steward receives an inflation amount according to `stewards_inflation_rate`; this amount is given to each steward and not divided among them.

#### Steward's reward distribution
A steward may also designate certain portions of its steward inflation to be minted to other addresses.
This distribution can be set with the following steward commission CLI command:

```shell copy
namadac  update-steward-rewards --steward $STEWARD_ADDRESS --data-path $PATH_TO/steward_rewards.json
```

The file `steward_rewards.json` contains the desired reward distribution with the structure:

```json
{
    "reward_distribution": {
        "tnam...aaa": "0.3",
        "tnam...bbb": "0.3",
        "tnam...ccc": "0.4"
    }
}
```
