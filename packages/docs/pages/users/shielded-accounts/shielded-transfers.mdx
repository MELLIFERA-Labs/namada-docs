# Shielded Transfers

Once the user has a [shielded balance](./shielding.mdx), it can be transferred to a another shielded address. This is known as a __shielded transfer__.

## Making a shielded transfer

Before making a shielded transfer, it is recommended to first sync the local shielded wallet. See how to do this [here](shielded-sync.mdx).

To make a shielded transfer, you must possess the relevant spending key. See the [introduction to Namada keys and addresses](../addresses.mdx#shielded-accounts) for
an explanation on the types of keys and addresses used with the MASP.

Use the `transfer` command to make a shielded transfer to a target shielded (`znam`) address by providing the spending key associated with the source shielded (`znam`) address:

```bash copy
namadac transfer \
  --source $SPENDING_KEY \
  --target $PAYMENT_ADDRESS \
  --token $TOKEN \
  --amount $AMOUNT \
  --gas-payer $IMPLICIT_ACCOUNT
```
<Callout>
Note: you must provide an implicit account which you control containing funds for transcation fees.
</Callout>


### Viewing your balance
To view the up-to-date balance of your spending key (or viewing key), you must first run the [`shielded-sync`](shielded-sync.mdx) command to
sync the local shielded wallet with any MASP notes owned by your spending/viewing key.

After the sync has completed, check your balance with:
```bash copy
namadac balance --owner $SPENDING_KEY --token $TOKEN
```
(A viewing key can also be provided here instead of `$SPENDING_KEY`)  

This will display the combined balance of all shielded addresses associated with that spending/viewing key.
