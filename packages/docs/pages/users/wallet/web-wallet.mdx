You can use the [Namada Keychain](https://namada.net/extension) browser extension to manage your keys within your browser. By connecting Namada Keychain with
web apps built for Namada, you can send or recieve tokens, make IBC transfers, or perform other actions such as voting on governance proposals. 

## Installation
The Namada Keychain extension is currently available on the [Chrome web store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/namada-extension/hnebcbhjpeejiclgbohcijljcnjdofek), with Firefox support coming soon.

## Set-up
After adding Namada Keychain to your browser, follow these steps to create a new wallet:

<Steps>

### Click 'Launch Initial Set-up'

### Add or create keys
You can choose 'Import existing keys' to import an existing wallet from your 12 or 24 word mnemonic, or raw private key. You can also use a Ledger hardware wallet; see [here](./hardware-wallet.mdx)
for further instructions.  

Click 'Create new keys' and verify that you have read and understood the message to proceed.

### Safely store your mnemonic
You will be shown your recovery mnemonic and asked to confirm that you have written it down. You can choose between a 12 or 24 word mnemonic using the toggle at the top.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="❗">
Write your mnemonic down and store it safely offline.  

It will allow you to recover your account. Without it, you risk losing access to your funds forever.
</Callout>

### Create and safely store your password
You will also be asked to create a password for your Namada Keychain. Write down this password; you will need to enter it regularly when using Namada Keychain.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="❗">
If you lose your password, you will lose access to your keys stored in Namada Keychain.

Remember: there's no 'recover password with email' option!

### Complete!
Your wallet is ready to use.
</Steps>

## Using Namada Keychain
The Namada Keychain extension itself only provides key management functionality. To send or receive tokens, you will need to navigate to a compatible
web app (such as [Namadillo](https://github.com/anoma/namada-interface)) and approve a connection to Namada Keychain from the site.  

Here's how to use Namada Keychain with Namadillo:

<Steps>
### Set the network in Namada Keychain
Open Namada Keychain and click the 'gear' icon in the top right, then select 'Network'.  

Enter a valid chain-id and rpc url for the chain you wish to transact on, and click 'Submit'.

### Navigate to a hosted instance of Namadillo
The Namadillo instance for the [Campfire testnet](../../networks/testnets/campfire.mdx) is hosted at [https://interface.luminara.icu](https://interface.luminara.icu). After mainnet
has launched, a list of hosted Namadillo instances will be found [here](../../networks/mainnets.mdx).

### Connect Namada Keychain
Click the 'Connect Extension' button and approve when prompted. If everything is configured correctly, you should now see your wallet balance displayed on the page.

### Interact
Once connected, you can use Namadillo to make transfers or stake with a validator (Note: some functionality may be missing on testnet).
Whenever you submit a transaction to the chain, you will be prompted to enter your password to allow Namada Keychain to sign using your private key.

### Disconnect
If you wish to disconnect (remove permissions) from a site, you can do so in the Settings menu of Namada Keychain, under 'Connected Sites'.

</Steps>

## Using a hardware wallet (Ledger)

with Namada Keychain.
