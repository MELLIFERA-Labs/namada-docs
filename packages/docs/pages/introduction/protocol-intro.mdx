# Introduction to the Namada Protocol

The Namada protocol is a proof-of-stake layer 1 blockchain protocol. State transitions are governed by validity predicates, and rules of the protocol are defined by protocol parameters. The following section describes key parameters and concepts, and how to query them.

## Epochs

The system relies on the concept of epochs. An epoch is a range of consecutive blocks identified by consecutive natural numbers. Each epoch lasts a minimum duration and includes a minimum number of blocks since the beginning of the last epoch. These are defined by protocol parameters.

To query the epoch duration parameters, the following command can be run:

```shell copy
namadac query-protocol-parameters
```

In order to query the current epoch of the chain, the following command can be run:

```shell copy
namadac epoch
```
## Protocol parameters

All of the current protocol parameters can be queried using the following command:
```shell copy
namadac query-protocol-parameters
```

This will display the list of protocol parameters.

### Governance parameters

- Min. proposal fund: The minimum amount of native tokens required to submit a proposal.
- Max. proposal code size: The maximum size of the code that can be submitted in a proposal.
- Min. proposal voting period: The minimum duration (in epochs) of the voting period for a proposal.
- Max. proposal period: The maximum duration (in epochs) of the proposal period.
- Max. proposal content size: The maximum number of characters of the content that can be submitted in a proposal.
- Min. proposal grace epochs: The minimum number of epochs between the end of a proposal's voting period and the epoch at which the code executes.

<Callout>
The proposal period is defined as the time between the epoch when voting begins (start epch) and the epoch when the proposal code would execute (activation epoch). 

Any changes enacted by a passing proposal (for example, changes to the protocol parameters) will take effect at the beginning of the activation epoch.
