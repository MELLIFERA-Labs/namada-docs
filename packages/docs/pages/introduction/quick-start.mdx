# Quickstart

Getting started with Namada is as simple as:  

<Steps>
### Install Namada
 
Install the Namada binaries (`namada`, `namadan`, `namadaw`, `namadac`) and place them in your `$PATH`.  

You can [build from source](#) or [download prebuilt binaries](#) from the Releases page of the Namada Github repo. [Docker images](#) are also available.
 
### Install CometBFT
 
[Install CometBFT](#) and place it in your `$PATH`.

### Join a Network
 
See the [networks page](../networks.mdx) for details on how to join a network. Joining a network is a one-step process to download the proper genesis files, wasm code and checksums, and initialize your node's storage and configuration.
You can join a [testnet](#), [localnet](#), or (soon) [mainnet](#).

### Start the Ledger Node
 
Start your node with:
```shell copy
namadan ledger run
```
Your node will begin syncing with the chain.
For a more verbose output, one can run:

```shell copy
NAMADA_LOG=info CMT_LOG_LEVEL=p2p:none,pex:error NAMADA_CMT_STDOUT=true namadan ledger run
```
To keep your node running in the background after closing your terminal, you will likely want to use either tmux or a systemd service file. See the section on [Running a full node](#) for more detail on this, as well as configuration options and environment variables.  

Instead of syncing your own node, you can use a [public rpc](#) for most functionality.

### Wait for your Node to Finish Syncing
This can take several hours depending on the chain height and your system specs.

### Create an Account
 
Create a new implicit account in order to receive tokens:

```shell copy
namadaw gen --alias <your-go-to-alias>
```
This will generate a new account and store it in the default keychain. You can view the account address with:

```shell copy
namadaw list --addr

# Sample output:
Known transparent addresses:
  ...
  "<your-go-to-alias>": Implicit: tnam1qzegva94xdnvtahqqetys9zzua6sdlm8sve05r9u
```

{/* #TODO: ADD some output */}

### Get Some Tokens from the Faucet (Testnet Only)
 
Testnet tokens can be sourced from the [faucet](https://faucet.heliax.click).

### Explore ðŸš€

There's a variety of cool things you can do next!
- [Shield some NAM or other tokens](#)
- [Bond (delegate) some tokens to a validator](#)
- [Become a validator yourself](#)
- [Participate in governance by creating or voting on proposals](#)
- [Send or recieve tokens from another chain via IBC](#)
