# Install From Binaries

## Pre-requisites
The following prerequisites are needed to use the pre-compiled binaries: 

These are: 
- [CometBFT](./binaries/prerequisites.mdx#installing-cometbft)
- [GLIBC](./binaries/prerequisites.mdx#installing-glibc)

## Downloading the binaries

After installing the prerequisites, you can download the latest binary release from our [releases page](https://github.com/anoma/namada/releases) by choosing the appropriate architecture.

The below code will download all the binaries for the latest release for all supported operating systems.
```shell copy
OPERATING_SYSTEM="Linux" # or "Darwin" for MacOS
latest_release_url=$(curl -s "https://api.github.com/repos/anoma/namada/releases/latest" | grep "browser_download_url" | cut -d '"' -f 4 | grep "$OPERATING_SYSTEM")
wget "$latest_release_url"
```

Older versions of the binaries are available from Github -- see the [releases page](https://github.com/anoma/namada/releases)

Unzip the `tar` using the following command:
```shell copy
#Assuming the user only has one namada tar file in the current directory
tar -xzvf namada*.tar.gz
```

## Placing the binaries onto `$PATH`
For ubuntu and mac machines, the following command should work for placing namada into path.

Once inside the directory containing the binaries:
```bash copy
sudo cp ./namada* /usr/local/bin/
```
Verify that the binaries are in your `$PATH` by running the command `which namada`.
