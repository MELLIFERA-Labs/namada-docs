# Cubic Slashing on Namada

Validators on Namada are slashed for misbehavior. Automatic slashing conditions are defined by the CometBFT, but validators can also report misbehavior by other validators. If a validator is deemed to have misbehaved, they are slashed by a certain amount of their stake. The amount of stake slashed, as well as the time required for the slash to take effect (pipeline) is defined by protocol parameters.

The Namada Proof of Stake (PoS) system uses the NAM token as the staking token. It features delegation to any number of validators and customizable validator validity predicates.

## PoS Validity Predicate

The PoS system is implemented as an account with the [PoS Validity Predicate](https://github.com/anoma/namada/blob/main/shared/src/ledger/pos/vp.rs) that governs the rules of the system. You can find its address in your wallet:

```shell copy
namada wallet find --alias PoS
```

## Epochs

The system relies on the concept of epochs. An epoch is a range of consecutive blocks identified by consecutive natural numbers. Each epoch lasts a minimum duration and includes a minimum number of blocks since the beginning of the last epoch. These are defined by protocol parameters.

To query the current epoch, the following command can be run:

```shell copy
namadac query-protocol-parameters
```

In order to query the current epoch, the following command can be run:

```shell copy
namada client epoch
```
## Pipeline length

Because of the nature of cubic slashing, validators are not slashed immediately upon evidence of misbehavior. Instead, the evidence is submitted to the network and the validator is slashed after a certain number of epochs. This is called the pipeline length. The pipeline length is defined by protocol parameters. It is possible to query the current pipeline length with the following command:

```shell copy
namada query-protocol-parameters
```
