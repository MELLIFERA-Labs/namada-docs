# Cubic Proof-of-Stake system

The Namada Proof of Stake (PoS) system uses the NAM token as the staking token. It features delegation to any number of validators and customizable validator validity predicates.

## PoS Validity Predicate

The PoS system is implemented as an account with the [PoS Validity Predicate](https://github.com/anoma/namada/blob/main/shared/src/ledger/pos/vp.rs) that governs the rules of the system. You can find its address in your wallet:

```shell copy
namada wallet address find --alias PoS
```

## Epochs

The system relies on the concept of epochs. An epoch is a range of consecutive blocks identified by consecutive natural numbers. Each epoch lasts a minimum duration and includes a minimum number of blocks since the beginning of the last epoch. These are defined by protocol parameters.

To query the current epoch, the following command can be run:

```shell copy
namadac query-protocol-parameters
```

In order to query the current epoch, the following command can be run:

```shell copy
namada client epoch
```

## Slashing

Validators on Namada are slashed for misbehavior. Automatic slashing conditions are defined by the CometBFT, but validators can also report misbehavior by other validators. If a validator is deemed to have misbehaved, they are slashed by a certain amount of their stake. The amount of stake slashed, as well as the time required for the slash to take effect (pipeline) is defined by protocol parameters.

## Jailing

Validators on Namada are jailed for either misbehaviour or for being offline for too long. If a number of blocks pass (also defined in the protocol parameters under `liveness_window_check`) in which none have been signed by the validator in question, the validator is jailed.

When a validator is jailed, they are unable to participate in the consensus protocol. A validator is jailed for at least the pipeline amount of epochs, but must be unjailed manually by the validator. This is done by submitting an `unjail-validator` command.

```bash
VALIDATOR_ALIAS="<your-validator-alias>"
SIGNING_KEYS="<your-signing-key(s)>"
namada client unjail-validator --validator $VALIDATOR_ALIAS --signing-keys $SIGNING_KEYS
```

If successful, the validator will be unjailed after the pipeline amount of epochs, and is able to participate in the consensus protocol again.
