# Setting up a Validator Node

This section details how to set up and run a validator node. It is divided into two sections -- pre-genesis validators and post-genesis validators.

### Prerequisites

- A machine that meets the [requirements](../hardware.mdx) for running a validator node
- An associated public static IPv4 address with ports 26656 reachable from anywhere for P2P connections
- You have [installed](../../introduction/install.mdx) Namada and its dependencies


## Pre-genesis validators

A pre-genesis validator is one which begins validating right from the first block of the chain, i.e., at genesis. 
The details of genesis validators are hardcoded into the genesis files that is distributed to all users who want to interact with a chain. Becoming a pre-genesis 
validator involves generating and signing a genesis transaction for inclusion in the genesis files; upon network launch, the validator can participate in 
consensus assuming they possess the expected consensus keys.

### Method

The method for setting up a genesis validator is described under the [pre-genesis participants](../networks/genesis-flow/participants.mdx#generate-a-pre-genesis-validator-account) section.


## Post-genesis validators

Post-genesis validators are validators that become initialized after the genesis block; this is the most common way of becoming a validator.

### Method
<Steps>
### Sync a full node
Before initializing your validator account, you must first [set up a full node](../ledger/running-a-full-node.mdx) and sync it with 
the head of the chain.

### Initialize a new validator account
A validator account can be initialized from an [established account](../../users/transparent-accounts/established-accounts.mdx) by submitting an on-chain transaction. 
`namadac init-validator` will create a new established account and convert it to a validator account in a single command.
<Callout>
You can also use the command `namadac become-validator` to convert an existing established account into a validator account, instead of creating a new one.
</Callout>

The required arguments to initialize a validator are:
```bash copy
namadac init-validator \
  --commission-rate 0.05 \
  --max-commission-rate-change 0.01 \
  --email <your-security-email> \
  --alias <account-wallet-alias>
```
__Note:__
- `commission-rate` is the percentage of staking rewards kept by the validator for all tokens bonded to it. A validator can change its commission rate 
by no more than `max-commission-rate-change` per epoch. The `max-commission-rate-change` parameter cannot be changed after validator initialization.
Typical values are `0.05` (5%) and `0.01` (1%) respectively but validator are free to choose otherwise.
- `email` should be set to a dedicated infra/security email account that you monitor regularly. It may be used to notify validators of urgent security issues, patches 
or chain upgrades.
- `alias` is used to reference your account by name in your wallet; it does not appear on-chain.

You can optionally provide any of the following additional information to identify your validator on-chain (frequently displayed in block explorers):
- `name`: An on-chain display name (similar to 'moniker' in Cosmos SDK chains)
- `avatar`: A url to your validator logo
- `discord-handle`: Your Discord handle
- `website`: A url to your validator website
- `description`: A 1-2 sentence description, tagline or slogan

### Restart your node
You must restart your node after initializing your validator; your node will be unable to sign any future blocks until you do so.

### Bond stake
A validator will only participate in consensus if the amount of tokens bonded meets both requirements:  
- Greater than the chain's `validator_stake_threshold` parameter, and  
- Enough to rank it among the top `X` active validators as defined by the `max_validator_slots` parameter. For example, if `max_validator_slots = 100`, then you must rank within the top 100 active validators by stake to participate in consensus.

Validators can bond tokens to themselves (self-bond) and solicit bonds from other parties (delegation); see the section on [staking](./staking.mdx). 
Note that the balance of NAM tokens that is in your validator account does not count towards your validator's stake and voting power.

### Await the `pipeline_length`
The chain's `pipeline_length` parameter defines the number of epochs that must pass before actions such as bonding, unbonding, or unjailing take effect. Therefore, 
after bonding sufficient stake to place in the active consensus set, you must wait an additional `pipeline_length` number of epochs before your validator is included in the consensus set.
