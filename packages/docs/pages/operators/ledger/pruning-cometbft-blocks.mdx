# Pruning CometBFT blocks

The size of the CometBFT directory will grow with validator signatures, transactions, etc.

The tool [CometPrune](https://github.com/ekhvalov/cometprune) can prune old blocks from your CometBFT directory. It reduces only the CometBFT data `${BASE_DIR}/${CHAIN_ID}/cometbft`, doesn't affect Namada's storage data `${BASE_DIR}/${CHAIN_ID}/db`.

### Install CometPrune
- Download the binary from [the release page](https://github.com/ekhvalov/cometprune/releases)

- Or, build from the source
```shell copy
git clone git@github.com:ekhvalov/cometprune.git
cd cometprune
go install
```

### Prune the blocks
1. Stop the node

2. Prune the blocks
```shell copy
cometprune --path ${BASE_DIR}/${CHAIN_ID}/cometbft/data --keep-blocks <amount of blocks to keep>
```
<Callout>
Leaving the last one block (`--keep-blocks 1`) is enough to restart the node. The tool will reject to delete all blocks, i.e. `--keep-blocks 0` doesn't work.

3. Restart the node
