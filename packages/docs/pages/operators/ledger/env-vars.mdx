# Node Configuration

By default, whenever the namada ledger is started, it will apply the confirguration found in the ledger configuration file `$BASE_DIR/$CHAIN_ID/config.toml`.

An example of a ledger configuration file is displayed below.

<Callout>
CometBFT has its own `config.toml` located inside the `cometbft` directory, however it should not be edited directly.
</Callout>

### Constructing environment variables
It is possible to override the configuration by setting environment variables; these will take precedence over any existing settings in `config.toml`.
Any variable found in the config can be accessed through environment variables that are constructed in the below manner.  

Names of the recognized environment variables are derived from the configuration keys by:

1. Prepend `NAMADA_` to the key
2. Uppercase every letter of the key. For example `p2p_pex` becomes `P2P_PEX`
3. Insert a `__` for each nested value. For example, `ledger.cometbft` becomes `LEDGER__COMETBFT`

Hence, the option `p2p_pex` in `[ledger.cometbft]` can be set by
```shell copy
NAMADA_LEDGER__COMETBFT__P2P_PEX=true # or false, depending on your heart's desires
``` 
in the environment 

<Callout type="warning">
**Note**: 
In principle, even `.` can be used for environment variable names. 
However, in Bash, only the double underscore form can be 
used, because Bash doesn't allow dots in environment variable names. 
Therefore, we omit the dot form.
