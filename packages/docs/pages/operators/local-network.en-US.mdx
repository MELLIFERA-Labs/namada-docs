# Spinning up a local network

## Prerequisites

Namada must be installed [from source](../introduction/install/source.mdx) in order to run a local network.

There is a script that has been written specifically for this purpose, which can be found under `scripts` in the [Namada repository](https://github.com/anoma/namada).

### Installing script dependencies

The script has some dependencies that must be installed in order to run it successfully:

1. python3 must be installed.
2. toml Python pip library https://pypi.org/project/toml/ must be installed.

The script will require a genesis configuration file, which is a TOML file that specifies the parameters of the network. Examples of such files can be found in the [anoma-network-config repo](https://github.com/heliaxdev/anoma-network-config) in the `templates` directory.

### Modifying the genesis configuration file

In order to run the script successfully, all sections of `validators` must be removed from the `toml` file. This is because the script will generate a new set of validators for the network.

The below code block shows an example of a genesis configuration file that has been modified to remove the `validators` section.

### Building wasm

The script will also require all `wasm` files for transactions to be built. This can be done by running the following command (whilst in the namada directory):

```shell
make build-wasm-scripts
````

## Running the script

The script is called `build_network.sh` and can be run with the following command:

```shell
# Ensure you are in the root of the namada repository directory
./scripts/build_network.sh <config_toml> <namada_dir> <OPTIONAL: base_dir>
```

More specifically, the script takes three arguments:

1. `config_toml`: the path to the ([validator-free](#modifying-the-genesis-configuration-file)) genesis configuration file.
2. `namada_dir`: the path to the Namada [binaries directory](../introduction/install/binaries/overview-of-binaries.mdx).
   If the binaries were build using `make build-release` this would imply the `namada/target/release` directory.
   Otherwise, if they were built using `make build` it would be the `namada/target/debug` directory.
3. `base_dir`: (optional argument) the path to the BASE_DIR directory, where all chain-data is stored.
   This is only necessary if the BASE_DIR is not the default given by `namadac utils default-base-dir` command.

For example, a MacOS user would run something along the lines of:

```shell
./scripts/build_network.sh \
~/anoma-network-config/templates/edited_genesis_config.toml \
./target/release # Assuming the binaries were built using `make build-release`
```

## Running the ledger

After the script has been run, a python process will have started in the background.
The ledger can be run through the familiar command:

```shell
target/release/namada ledger # Assuming the binaries were built using `make build-release`
```

## Cleaning up

After the local network has fulfilled its purpose, it can be cleaned up by running the following commands found in the cleanup function of the script:

```shell copy
    pkill -f ".hack/chains"
    rm -r .hack/chains
    rm local.*.tar.gz
```
