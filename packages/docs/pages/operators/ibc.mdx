# Relaying on Namada

This section of the documentation describes how to operate a relayer on Namada, how to open IBC connections with other IBC compatible chains and how to 
test your relayer setup by making a connection between two mock local chains.


## Introduction
Relayers are a crucial piece of infrastructure that allow IBC compatible chains to pass messages to one another. 
A relayer is responsible for posting IBC packets to the destination chain, as well as performing other IBC functions 
such as creating channels, updating the light client states and checking for misbehavior.  

Operating a relayer is permissionless. If at least one relayer is not running on a given channel between two chains, 
they will not be able to pass messages to each other on that channel. IBC transfers that are attempted but not picked 
up by a relayer will timeout and the tokens will be refunded to the sender.

To operate a relayer, you will need:
- A dedicated server
- [Hermes](#install-hermes); the relayer software. Heliax maintains a fork of Hermes compatible with Namada.
- Full nodes on both chains; a relayer needs to access several weeks worth of chain history and to frequently post 
transactions to both chains. For testing, a public RPC node may suffice, but for production it is highly recommended 
for reliability that relayer operators also operate both full nodes themselves.
- Gas funds for each chain; since relayers will need to regularly post transactions to both chains, they will need a 
wallet on each with enough funds to cover gas costs (monitoring and topping up as necessary).  


This document covers the essentials for installing, configuring and running a relayer on Namada:

1. [Installing Hermes](#install-hermes)
2. [Configuring Hermes](#configure-hermes)
3. [Setting up the relayer](#setting-up-the-relayer)
4. [Creating an IBC channel](#creating-an-ibc-channel)
5. [Running the relayer](#start-the-relayer)

And for setting up a testing environment by running two local Namada chains, see the section 
[Testing with local Namada chains](#set-up-local-namada-chains-using-the-hermes-script)

<Steps>
### Installing Hermes
Heliax maintains a fork of the Hermes relayer software. You can download a prebuilt binary or build it from source.

#### From binaries
One can download the latest binary release from our [releases page](https://github.com/heliaxdev/hermes/releases) by choosing the appropriate architecture.

E.g.
```bash copy
export TAG="v1.8.2-namada-beta11" # or the appropriate release for your version of namada
export ARCH="x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu" # or "aarch64-apple-darwin"
curl -Lo /tmp/hermes.tar.gz https://github.com/heliaxdev/hermes/releases/download/${TAG}/hermes-${TAG}-${ARCH}.tar.gz
tar -xvzf /tmp/hermes.tar.gz -C /usr/local/bin
```

<Callout type="info">
For some systems, `/usr/local/bin` is a protected directory. In this case, you may need to run the above command with `sudo`.
I.e 
```bash copy
sudo tar -xvzf /tmp/hermes.tar.gz -C /usr/local/bin
```
This is also true for the command `cp ./target/release/hermes /usr/local/bin/` below (see the comment).
</Callout>

#### From source
```bash copy
export TAG="v1.8.2-namada-beta11" # or the appropriate release for your version of namada

git clone https://github.com/heliaxdev/hermes.git
git checkout $TAG
cd hermes
cargo build --release --bin hermes
export HERMES=$(pwd) # if needed
```
Check the binary:
```bash copy
./target/release/hermes --version
```

<Callout type="info">
It is recommended to now add hermes to `$PATH` such that it is callable without any pre-fixes.
For ubuntu users, this can be achieved by
```bash copy
sudo cp ./target/release/hermes /usr/local/bin/
```
</Callout>

### Configuring Hermes

#### Make Hermes config file
Hermes' `config.toml` file defines which chains and channels the relayer will be responsible for. First, create that file:

```bash copy
export HERMES_CONFIG="$HOME/.hermes/config.toml"
touch $HERMES_CONFIG
``` 

When running Hermes commands, if you don't specify the config file path, `~/.hermes/config.toml` is read as default.

__You can find an example of the config file below__. Essentially, you change only the chain IDs, the RPC addresses, and the key names in the config file for Namada. 
If you don't have nodes, please set up nodes manually or through our [scripts](#set-up-local-namada-chains-using-the-hermes-script).

<Callout type="info" emoji="ðŸ§©">
**Interpreting the toml**

Each chain configuration is specified under the `[[chains]]` object.
These are the pieces of this puzzle you want to keep your ðŸ‘€ on:
 - `chains.id` is the name of the chain
 - `chains.rpc_address` specifies the port that the channel is communicating through, and will be the argument for the `ledger_address` of Namada when interacting with the ledger (will become clearer later)
     - Make sure to change the IP address to the IP address of your local machine that is running this node!
 - `chains.grpc_addr` currently is not used in Namada but needs to be configured for other Cosmos chains
 - `chains.key_name` specifies the key of the signer who signs a transaction from the relayer. The key should be generated before starting the relayer and 
 will need to be kept topped up with gas funds.
 - `chains.event_source` specifies the URL of the chain's websocket. This must be the same as the `rpc_address` for Hermes to work properly.
 - `chains.gas_price.denom` specifies the token that the relayer pays for IBC transactions. `chains.gas_price.price` isn't used for now in Namada.
 - `trusting_period` specifies the maximum period before which the client can not expire. This should be not more than unbonding time in the particular chain. 

You can see more details of configuration in [the official document](https://hermes.informal.systems/documentation/configuration).
</Callout>

#### Export environment variables
You may find it convenient to save certain environment variables. These are:
```bash copy
export CHAIN_A_ID="<replace-with-chain-a-id>"
export CHAIN_B_ID="<replace-with-chain-b-id>"
export HERMES_CONFIG="<replace-with-hermes-config-path>"
```

### Setting up the relayer

#### Create the relayer account
On each chain, there must be a `relayer` account. The alias should be the same as `chains.key_name` in the config. On a Namada chain, this can be done by running
```bash copy
namadaw gen --alias relayer
```

This will generate a key for the relayer account. The key will be stored in the `wallet.toml` that is found in the [base directory](./ledger/base-directory.mdx) of the node, inside the `chain-id` folder. For example, if the `chain-id` is `shielded-expedition.88f17d1d14`, the `wallet.toml` will be found in `$HOME/.local/share/namada/shielded-expedition.88f17d1d14/wallet.toml` (on a Ubuntu machine where `base-dir` has not been changed from default).

The relayer account should have some balance to pay the fee of transactions. Before creating an IBC channel or relaying an IBC packet, you need to transfer the fee token to the relayer account.

#### Add the relayer key to Hermes
To sign each transaction, the relayer's key should be added to Hermes with `keys add` command in advance. 
It requires the `wallet.toml` which should have the key of `chains.key_name`. Once the key has been added, Hermes doesn't 
need the wallet anymore. (Rather than providing the `wallet.toml`, you can instead provide a text file which contains the 24 word mnemonic for your key.)
```bash copy
hermes --config $HERMES_CONFIG keys add --chain $CHAIN_ID --key-file $WALLET_PATH
# or
hermes --config $HERMES_CONFIG keys add --chain $CHAIN_ID --mnemonic-file $SEED_PATH
```

Hermes will store the key in `~/.hermes/keys/${CHAIN_ID}` as default. You can specify the directory by setting `chains.key_store_folder` in the config file.

<Callout type="info">
If you want to use an encrypted key with a password, you have to set an environment variable `NAMADA_WALLET_PASSWORD_FILE` for the password file or `NAMADA_WALLET_PASSWORD` to avoid entering the password for each transaction submission.
</Callout>

#### Verify configuration files
After editing `config.toml` and adding wallet keys, it's time to test the configurations and ensure the system is healthy. Run the following:

```bash copy
hermes health-check
hermes config validate
```
If everything was set up correctly, you should see output like:
``` bash copy
SUCCESS performed health check for all chains in the config
SUCCESS "configuration is valid"
```

### Creating an IBC channel
All IBC transfers between two chains take place along a given IBC channel associated with a given IBC connection.  

Channels must be maintained after creation by regularly submitting headers to keep the client state up to date with 
the counterparty chain. A client that is allowed to fall out of date may expire, and further IBC transfers along the 
channel will not be possible until the client is revived through governance. Operators should not create new channels 
on public networks unneccessarily; instead, they should relay on existing channels if possible. 

<Callout type='warning'>
The same asset transferred through different channels will not be fungible on the destination chain. Therefore, to avoid 
confusion and liquidity fragmentation, it is good etiquette to check with a chain's community before creating any 
new channels and to use existing channels whenever possible.
</Callout>

If no existing channel can be used, the "create channel" command (below) creates not only the IBC channel but also the necessary IBC client connection.

```bash copy
hermes --config $HERMES_CONFIG \
  create channel \
  --a-chain $CHAIN_A_ID \
  --b-chain $CHAIN_B_ID \
  --a-port transfer \
  --b-port transfer \
  --new-client-connection --yes
```

<Callout type="info">
Note that the above `CHAIN_IDs` will depend on your own setup, so do check this for yourself!
</Callout>

When the creation has been completed, you can see the channel IDs. For example, the output text below shows that a channel with ID `955` has been created on Chain A `shielded-expedition.88f17d1d14`, 
and a channel with ID `460` has been created on Chain B `axelar-testnet-lisbon-3`.  

Note the channel id's, as you will need to specify the channel IDs when making a transfer over IBC. You specify `channel-955` as a channel ID 
for a transfer from Chain A to Chain B. Also, you specify 
`channel-460` as a channel ID for a transfer from Chain B to Chain A. (The prefix `channel-` is always required) 

Also note the ClientId for each of the chains; we will need them on the next step:  
`07-tendermint-2996` for `shielded-expedition.88f17d1d14` and `07-tendermint-884` for `axelar-testnet-lisbon-3`

```bash copy
export CLIENT_A_ID="<replace-with-client-a-id>"
export CLIENT_B_ID="<replace-with-client-b-id>"
```

```

#### Update Hermes configuration

By default, Hermes will attempt to relay packets on all channels between the chains listed in its configuration file.
We can restrict Hermes to only relay packets on our newly created channels by updating the [Hermes configuration](#Make-Hermes-config-file) 
with the following (for each chain):

```bash copy
...
[chains.packet_filter]
policy = 'allow'
list = [
  ['transfer', '<channel-id>'], #channel-id leading to the counterparty channel you want to use for IBC
]
...
```

### Running the relayer
While Hermes is running, it monitors chains via the nodes and relays packets according to monitored events. You will 
likely want to use `systemd`, `tmux`, `Docker` or some similar solution to ensure Hermes is running persistently in the background.  

The command to run Hermes is simply:
```bash copy
hermes --config $HERMES_CONFIG start
```

You can see more details of Hermes at [the official documentation](https://hermes.informal.systems/).


#### Updating IBC clients

In order to keep IBC channels open for transfers, they must have active IBC clients. An IBC client on chain A references 
the state of chain B, and vice versa. These clients must be regularly updated to maintain trust guarantees; if they are 
allowed to lapse, the client will enter an 'expired' state and no further IBC transfers will be allowed on that channel 
until the client is revived through governance.  

Whenever Hermes relays an IBC transfer, it will automatically update the clients on both chains. However, since reviving 
an expired client through governance is a time-consuming task, it is worthwhile to regularly submit manual updates to 
avoid any issues should transfer frequency be lower than expected.  

The "update channel" command (below) manually updates the state of a client on a particular chain.

```bash copy
hermes update client --host-chain $CHAIN_A_ID --client $CLIENT_A_ID
hermes update client --host-chain $CHAIN_B_ID --client $CLIENT_B_ID
```

It is recommended to schedule the above commands to run periodically (using a scheduler such `cron` or `systemd`) so that any client expiration issues can be avoided entirely.

### Done!
You're now ready to test [transferring assets between the two chains.](../users/ibc.mdx)

</Steps>

## Testing with local Namada chains
The script `setup-namada` in the Heliax Hermes repo will set up two chains, each with one validator node, copy necessary files for Hermes, 
and make an account for Hermes on each ledger. Also, it will make a Hermes' config file `config_for_namada.toml` 
in the `hermes` directory.

First, you will need to export some environment variables:

```bash copy
export NAMADA_DIR="<path-to-namada-source-directory>"
export TAG="v1.8.2-namada-beta11" # or the appropriate hermes version for your namada version
```

```bash copy
git clone https://github.com/heliaxdev/hermes.git
git checkout $TAG # The branch is the same as our Hermes
cd hermes
./scripts/setup-namada $NAMADA_DIR
```

In this case, the user doesn't have to wait for sync. If the relayer account on each instance has enough balance, the user can create a channel and start Hermes immediately as explained [above](#create-ibc-channel). The user finds these chain IDs of the chains in the config file `config_for_namada.toml`. One can run `grep "id" ${HERMES_CONFIG}`.
```bash copy
# create a channel
hermes --config $HERMES_CONFIG \
  create channel \
  --a-chain $CHAIN_A_ID \
  --b-chain $CHAIN_B_ID \
  --a-port transfer \
  --b-port transfer \
  --new-client-connection --yes

# Run Hermes
hermes --config $HERMES_CONFIG start
```

Each node data and configuration files are in `hermes/data/namada-*/.namada`.

In order to close any ledgers setup by the script, one can run
```bash copy
killall namadan
```
