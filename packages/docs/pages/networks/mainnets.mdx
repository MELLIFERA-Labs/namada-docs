# Mainnets
The Namada mainnet is currently live after having been launched on December 3 @ 15:00 UTC.

The genesis files are hosted in the following repository: https://github.com/anoma/namada-mainnet-genesis.

### Mainnet status and attributes:
- chain ID: `namada.5f5de2dd1b88cba30586420`
- Namada binaries: [`v1.1.1`](https://github.com/anoma/namada/releases/tag/v1.1.1)
- Namada libs: [`v0.47.2`](https://github.com/anoma/namada/releases/tag/libs-v0.47.2)
- CometBFT version: [`v0.37.15`](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/releases/tag/v0.37.15)

### Joining the network from the CLI
The simplest way to join the network is the following:
```
export NAMADA_NETWORK_CONFIGS_SERVER="https://github.com/anoma/namada-mainnet-genesis/releases/download/mainnet-genesis"
export CHAIN_ID=namada.5f5de2dd1b88cba30586420
 
# Download the network files and join
namadac utils join-network --chain-id $CHAIN_ID
```

With these steps, a user can join the Namada mainnet, allowing for querying and transacting on the blockchain.
These beginning steps are necessary for running a full node or a validator node as well.
More details on how to join the network in these cases can be found in [this mainnet guide](https://github.com/anoma/namada-mainnet-genesis/blob/main/MAINNET-GUIDE.md).

### Services and infrastructure

The `namada-ecosystem` repository contains data on the available mainnet services and infrastructure in json format in [this directory](https://github.com/Luminara-Hub/namada-ecosystem/tree/main/user-and-dev-tools/mainnet).
This is an actively maintained resource for finding RPC nodes to connect to, active IBC relayers, Namadillo front-end instances, active indexers, state snapshot providers and more.

Block explorers and Namadillo instances can also be found on https://namada.net/apps.
