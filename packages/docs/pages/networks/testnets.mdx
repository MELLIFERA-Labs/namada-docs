## Shielded expedition

<Callout type="info" emoji="ðŸ‘·">
For the shielded expedition, it is important to remember to add the `--memo` flag to every transaction. The memo should be filled with the `tpknam` submitted at the shielded-expedition registration period.
For example `namadac transfer --source me --target you --amount 10 --token naan --signing-keys my-key --memo tpknamq1337mypubkey1964qqqqqq`
</Callout>

<Callout>
As of version `v0.31.8` you must specify `--node http://127.0.0.1:26657` when running `namadac` commands. This is a temporary bug until the `namadac` client is updated.
</Callout>

The `balances.toml` file is located at `https://github.com/anoma/namada-shielded-expedition`.
