# Live Testnets

Currently, while the Namada mainnet is live and has not reached Phase 5 of the mainnet launch, two public test networks are currently running, housefire and campfire.

### Housefire Testnet
This is a mainnet-tracking testnet and the intended primary staging ground for software upgrades and governance proposals.
Before Phase 5 of mainnet, it is used to test the proposals to advance between the phases.

[Instructions to join and use the testnet](https://testnet.housefire.tududes.com).

### Campfire (??) Testnet
A more experimental testnet that is already configured to have full, Phase 5 functionality at genesis.
This network will be abandoned once the Namada mainnet and housefire testnet reach Phase 5 functionality.
