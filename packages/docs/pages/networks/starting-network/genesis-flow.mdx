# Setting up a decentralized Namada network

Setting up a decentralized Namada network requires coordination between two distinct parties:

1. [The network coordinator](./genesis-flow/coordinator.mdx#the-network-coordinator)
2. [The pre-genesis participants](./genesis-flow/participants.mdx#pre-genesis-network-participants)

This process is also called the **genesis ceremony** or the **pre-genesis process**.  

The purpose of this process is to establish the initial (genesis) state of the network -- including initial account balances, an initial validator set and an initial stake distribution -- through social consensus. 
This is done by generating *pre-genesis transactions* that define established accounts, validator accounts, and bonds. See the [pre-genesis participants](./genesis-flow/participants.mdx#pre-genesis-network-participants) 
section for more details on generating pre-genesis transactions.
