# The Namada Campfire Testnet ‚õ∫üî•

<Callout type="info">
The Namada Campfire ‚õ∫üî• testnet is run in parallel to the "validator" testnet. This is a community-run testnet, currently being maintained and orchestrated by the [Luminara collective](https://luminara.icu), a small group of Namada supporters. Campfire usually runs the latest release (or pre-release), which may differ from the validator testnet. You can see the version and more at https://testnet.luminara.icu
</Callout>

## Joining 

<Callout type="info" emoji="üèïÔ∏è">
The most up-to-date docs on joining Campfire ‚õ∫üî• can be found [here](https://knowabl.notion.site/Campfire-testnet-5e4c1df53ab64b818a55bfcf36ccc550).
</Callout>

### Pre-requisites

<Callout type="warning" emoji="‚ùó">
Currently, Campfire ‚õ∫üî• docs only detail support for Ubuntu machines. However, the steps should be the same for any OS which can run Namada.
</Callout>

The user will need to have completed the steps to install [Namada](../../introduction/install.mdx) and [CometBFT](../../introduction/installing-cometbft.mdx) as per usual.

### Joining the network

<Callout type="info" emoji="üèïÔ∏è">
Check the testnet [info page](https://testnet.luminara.icu) which should have all info and links needed to join the network, including
the current chain-id, peers, wasm files, etc.  

This page is automatically re-generated on chain creation so the info contained should always be current.
</Callout>

Configuring your node to join Campfire is similar to any other public testnet, with a couple minor differences.

<Steps>
### Set config server
First, set this environment variable to instruct `namadac` to download the chain configs from an alternate URL.
```bash copy
export NAMADA_NETWORK_CONFIGS_SERVER="https://testnet.luminara.icu/configs"
```

### Join network
Run this command to download the chain configs. Don't forget the `--dont-prefetch-wasm` flag as we'll manually download and copy
the wasm files into the chain directory in the next step.
```bash copy
namadac utils join-network --chain-id $CHAIN_ID --dont-prefetch-wasm
```

### Download and extract the chain wasm files
Download the wasm files from the link on [https://testnet.luminara.icu](https://testnet.luminara.icu) and copy them into the `wasm`
directory inside your Namada base-dir.
```bash copy
wget https://testnet.luminara.icu/wasm.tar.gz
tar -xf wasm.tar.gz
cp wasm/* ~/.local/share/namada/$CHAIN_ID/wasm/
```

### Update persistent peers
Check [https://testnet.luminara.icu](https://testnet.luminara.icu) for a current persistent peer (or ask in the Discord server) and
add it to your node's `config.toml` file (located at `<NAMADA_BASE_DIR>/$CHAIN_ID/config.toml`).
```bash copy
# actual value will be different
persistent_peers = "tcp://0e51028c038607680cde50fdb08b6931e869ce6a@143.198.36.225:26656‚Äù
```

### (Optional) Sync using a snapshot
For faster syncing, you can download a recent snapshot from  [https://testnet.luminara.icu](https://testnet.luminara.icu).  

You will need to install lz4:
```bash copy
sudo apt install lz4
```

Once you have downloaded the snapshot, you can extract it with:
```bash copy
lz4 -c -d <snapshot filename>.tar.lz4  | tar -x -C $HOME/temp
```

After extracting, use the `db` folder to replace `NAMADA_BASE_DIR/$CHAIN_ID/db` and the `data` folder to replace NAMADA_BASE_DIR/$CHAIN_ID/cometbft/data`.

### Start your node!
```bash copy
NAMADA_LOG=info CMT_LOG_LEVEL=p2p:none,pex:error NAMADA_CMT_STDOUT=true namada node ledger run
```
</Steps>

## Interacting with the testnet

Campfire includes a faucet, public rpc, wallet interface, indexer, and (hopefully soon) explorer. Check the [landing page](https://testnet.luminara.icu) for links and further info.
