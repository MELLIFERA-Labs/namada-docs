## VP logic

## Governance Address

All on-chain governance mechanisms are handled under a single address, referred to as the `GovernanceAddress`.
The `GovernanceAddress` is created during genesis, and handles the verification of submitted proposals, the tallying of votes, and the execution of proposals.
This address also stores all previous proposals under its address space.

Proposals are submitted through the client, and are verified by the `GovernanceAddress` before being added to the pending proposals list.

The structure of proposals is outlined [here](./proposal.mdx).


The correct logic to handle these different types is hardcoded in protocol. 
We'll also rely on type checking to strictly enforce the correctness of a proposal given its type. 
These two approaches combined will prevent a user from deviating from the intended logic for a certain proposal type (e.g. providing a wasm code when it's not needed or allowing only validators to vote when also delegators should, etc...). 
More details on the specific types supported can be found in the [relative](#supported-proposal-types) section of the [proposals page](./proposal.mdx).


### GovernanceAddress VP

The `GovernanceAddress` validity predicate (VP) task is to check the integrity and correctness of new proposals. 

#### Submission validation
A proposal must satisfy the following mandatory storage writes:

- `counter` - The number of proposals submitted so far
- `author` - The address of the author of the proposal
- `type` - The [proposal type](./proposal.mdx#supported-proposal-types)
- `funds` - The amount of funds locked for this proposal
- `voting_start` - The epoch specifying when the voting period starts
- `voting_end`- The epoch specifying when the voting period ends
- `grace_epoch` - The epoch specifying when the proposal becomes active, (and attached WASM code is executed if any), given that the proposal has a positive outcome.

Further, it must check that the proposal satisfies the following constraints:
- The attached `funds` is >= `min_proposal_fund`, a protocol parameter
- The `id` of the proposal is unique
- The attached `ProposalType` is supported by the protocol
- The difference between StartEpoch and EndEpoch is >= `min_proposal_period`
- There is an attached `description` of the proposal with character length < `max_proposal_content_size`
- The difference between the `voting_end` and `voting_start` epoch must be divisible by 3, i.e `(EndEpoch - StartEpoch) % 3 == 0`.
- The difference between `grace_epoch` and `voting_end` is of at least `min_proposal_grace_epochs`, a protocol parameter.
The reason for this constraint is explained below. 

#### Voting validation

Once a proposal has been accepted by the protocol as valid, it will be added to the pending proposals list, and delegators and delegates will be able to vote on it.
The VP must also check that voting adheres to the following constraints:

- The voter is a delegator or a delegate (further constraints can be applied depending on the proposal type)
- Given that non-validating accounts can vote, validators may only vote during the initial $\frac{2}{3}$ of the whole proposal duration (`voting_end` - `voting_start`)

Once a proposal has been created, nobody can modify any of its fields.

#### Execution of WASM code

The VP is also responsible for handling the execution of WASM code attached to a `DefaultProposal` proposal type.

Examples of such code execution could be:
- storage writes to change some protocol parameter
- storage writes to restore a slash

This means that corresponding VPs will also be invoked.


## Tallying votes

Proposals are tallied at the start of their `grace_epoch` during the `finalize_block` function.
The tallying is based off of the votes collected at the end of the `voting_end` epoch.
If the threshold specified by the ProposalType is reached, the proposal will be considered successful.

There are two types of thresholds:
    - Fraction of total staked `NAM` that voted - This checks whether enough staked `NAM` voted for the proposal at all.
    - Fraction of votes in favor of the proposal - This checks whether enough votes (weighted by their staked `NAM`) voted in favor of the proposal, out of the staked `NAM` that did vote.

E.g if the thresholds, respectively, are $\frac{1}{2}$ and $\frac{1}{3}$, then at least 50% of the total staked `NAM` must have voted for the proposal AND out of this NAM, to be accepted.

Tallying is computed with the following rules:

<Steps>

1. Sum all the voting power of delegates that voted `Yay`, call this sum `SumYay`
2. Sum all the voting power of delegates that voted `Nay`, call this sum `SumNay`
3. Sum all the voting power of delegates that voted `Abstain`, call this sum `SumAbstain`
4. Check if the sum `SumYay` + `SumNay` + `SumAbstain` meets the first threshold, if not, the proposal outcome is negative
5. For any delegate that voted `Yay`, subtract the voting power of any delegator that voted other than `Yay` from `SumYay`
6. For any delegate that voted `Nay`, subtract the voting power of any delegator that voted other than `Nay` from `SumNay`
7. For any delegate that voted `Abstain`, subtract the voting power of any delegator that voted other than `Abstain` from `SumAbstain`
8. Add voting power for any delegation that voted `Yay` (whose corresponding delegate didn't vote `Yay`) to `SumYay`
9. Add voting power for any delegation that voted `Nay` (whose corresponding delegate didn't vote `Nay`) to `SumNay`
9. Add voting power for any delegation that voted `Abstain` (whose corresponding delegate didn't vote `Abstain`) to `SumAbstain`
10. Set `SumYeaOrNay` to `SumYay` + `SumNay`
11. Decide whether or not the proposal succeeds based on the proposal-type-specific tally instructions (see [Proposal](./proposal.mdx))

</Steps>

All the computation is done at the start of `grace_epoch` on data collected at the epoch specified in the `voting-end` field of the proposal.

## Tallying votes offline

Offline votes are tallied under the same mechanism as on-chain vote tallying, but instead of reading the data from storage it will require a list of serialized json votes.
The voting power for each delegate/delegator is calculated based on their respective bonded-stake from the latest block in that epoch (in principle it could be any block in the epoch, since voting-power does not change within an epoch).

### Refund and Proposal Execution mechanism

In parallel to tallying, the protocol manages the execution of accepted proposals and refunding in the `finalize_block` function. 
If the proposals `grace_epoch` matches with the current epoch, AND the proposal had a positive outcome, the protocol refunds the locked funds from `GovernanceAddress` to the proposal author address (specified in the proposal `author` field).  
Moreover, if the proposal had a positive outcome and had attached WASM code, the code is executed immediately.

On the other hand, should the proposal be rejected (negative outcome), any locked funds is burnt (removed from total supply).

The result is then signaled by creating and inserting a [`CometBFT Event`](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/blob/main/spec/abci/abci%2B%2B_basic_concepts.md#events).
