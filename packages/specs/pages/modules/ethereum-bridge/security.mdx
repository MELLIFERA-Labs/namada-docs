# Security

On Namada, the validators are full nodes of Ethereum and their stake is also
accounting for security of the bridge. If they carry out a forking attack
on Namada to steal locked tokens of Ethereum their stake will be slashed on Namada.
On the Ethereum side, there exists a limit to the amount of assets that can be
locked to limit the damage a forking attack on Namada can do. To make an attack
more cumbersome there also exists a limit on how fast wrapped Ethereum assets can
be redeemed from Namada. This does not add more security, but rather makes the 
attack more inconvenient, and allows governance time to react.
