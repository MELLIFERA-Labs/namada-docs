# Ethereum Events Attestation

Namada stores events from the smart contracts of its bridge. Namada includes events that have been voted by at least one
validator, but will not act on them until they have been `seen` by a
weighted average of more than $\frac{2}{3}$ of the voting power
available across all epochs of the tally. Generically, Namada considers some
tally $t$ `seen` if it satisfies the following inequality:

$$\sum_{E \in \xi} (\frac{\sigma(E)}{\sum_{E' \in \xi} \sigma(E')} \cdot F_E) > \frac{2}{3}$$

Where $\xi$ is the set of epochs when $t$ took place, $\sigma$ is a
function mapping an epoch to its total voting power and $F_E$ is the
total fractional voting power aggregated behind a tally at some epoch
$E$ (for instance, at $E_0$,
$F_{E_0} = \frac{\frac{1}{2} \cdot \sigma(E_0)}{\sigma(E_0)}$). The only
way to break the security of $t$ is if a set of Byzantine validators
control an average of $\frac{1}{3}$ of the voting power available across
$\xi$.

There will be multiple types of events emitted. Validators should ignore
improperly formatted events. ABI encoded events from Ethereum are
decoded by [`ethbridge-rs`](https://github.com/heliaxdev/ethbridge-rs),
and converted to a Rust enum type (`EthereumEvent`) by Namada validators
before being included in vote extensions or stored on chain.

``` rust
pub enum EthereumEvent {
    // Namada has different variants corresponding to different types
    // of raw events Namada receives from Ethereum
    TransfersToNamada(Vec<TransferToNamada>)
    // ...
}
```

Validators may never vote more than once on a given event. To ensure
that this invariant is held, Namada keep track of who voted on some event
and events are timed out if they are not `seen` within the span of
`unbonding_length` epochs, which corresponds to the period of time
necessary for bonded tokens to be returned to an address (check the
[relevant proof-of-stake
section](../proof-of-stake/reward-distribution.mdx) for more
details). Timing out an event consists of removing all its associated
state from storage. Therefore, this mechanism serves another purpose:
purging forged events from storage, voted on by Byzantine validators.

## Minimum confirmations

There will be a protocol-specified minimum number of confirmations that
events must reach on the Ethereum chain, before validators can vote to
include them on Namada. This minimum number of confirmations will be
changeable via governance.

`TransferToNamada` events may include a custom minimum number of
confirmations that must be at least the protocol-specified minimum
number of confirmations. However, this value is initially set to
**100**.

Validators must not vote to include events that have _yet_ to meet the
required number of confirmations. Votes on unconfirmed events will
eventually time out in storage.
Assuming that an honest
majority of validators is operating Namada (i.e. $\ge \frac{2}{3}$ by
voting power across all epochs in the tally), only confirmed events will
eventually become `seen`.

## Vote extension protocol transactions

A batch of Ethereum events $E$ newly confirmed at some block height $H$
is included by some validator $v$ in a protocol transaction Namada dubs the
*Ethereum events vote extension*. The vote extension is signed by the
protocol key of $v$, uniquely identifying $v$'s vote on some Ethereum
event $e \in E$ at $H$.

Namada validators perform votes on other kinds of data, namely:

1)  Validator set update vote extensions. As the name implies, these are
    used to sign off on the set of validators of some epoch $i' = i + 1$
    by the validators of epoch $i$. The proof (quorum of signatures) is
    used to update the validator set reflected in the Ethereum smart
    contracts of the bridge.
2)  Bridge pool root vote extensions. These vote extensions are used to
    reach a quorum decision on the most recent root and nonce of the
    [Ethereum bridge pool](./transfers_to_ethereum.mdx).

These protocol transactions are only ever included on-chain if the
Tendermint version that is being used to run the ledger does not include
a full ABCI++ (i.e. ABCI 2.0) implementation. Alternatively, nodes
receive vote extensions from the previously decided block, never lagging
behind more than one block height. Without ABCI++, vote extensions are
included in arbitrary blocks, based on the contention of block
proposers' mempools. This effectively means that a vote extension for
some height $H_0$ may only be acted upon at some height $H \gg H_0$, or
even evicted from the mempool altogether, if it is never proposed.

## Storage

To make including new events easy, Namada takes the approach of always
overwriting the state with the new state rather than applying state
diffs. The storage keys involved are:

```
# all values are Borsh-serialized
/eth_msgs/$msg_hash/body: EthereumEvent # the event to be voted on
/eth_msgs/$msg_hash/seen_by: BTreeMap<Address, BlockHeight> # mapping from a validator to the Namada height at which the event was observed to be confirmed by said validator
/eth_msgs/$msg_hash/voting_power: BTreeMap<Epoch, FractionalVotingPower> # mapping from epochs to aggregated voting powers, in the form of a reduced fraction < 1 e.g. (2, 3)
/eth_msgs/$msg_hash/seen: bool # >= 2/3 average voting power across all epochs it was voted on
/eth_msgs/$msg_hash/voting_started_epoch: Epoch # epoch when the tally started
```

Where `$msg_hash` is the SHA256 digest of the Borsh serialization of
some `EthereumEvent`.

Changes to this `/eth_msgs` storage subspace are only ever made by nodes
as part of the ledger code based on the aggregate of votes by validators
for specific events. That is, changes to `/eth_msgs` happen in block `n`
in a deterministic manner based on the votes included in the block
proposal for block `n`. Depending on the underlying Tendermint version,
these votes will either be included as vote extensions or as protocol
transactions.

The `/eth_msgs` storage subspace will belong to the `EthBridge` validity
predicate. It should disallow any changes to this storage from wasm
transactions.

### Including events into storage

For every Namada block proposal, the proposer should include the votes
for events from other validators into their proposal. If the underlying
Tendermint version supports vote extensions, consensus invariants
guarantee that a quorum of votes from the previous block height can be
included. Otherwise, validators can only submit votes by broadcasting
protocol transactions, which comes with less guarantees (i.e. no
consensus finality).

The vote of a validator should include each event of the Ethereum blocks
their full node has seen that satisfies the following conditions:

1.  The event is correctly formatted.
2.  It has reached the required number of confirmations on the Ethereum
    chain.
3.  If a transfer to Ethereum event is detected, the underlying asset
    must be whitelisted on the Ethereum bridge smart contracts.

Each event that a validator is voting to include must be individually
signed by them. If the validator is not voting to include any events,
they must still provide a signed empty vector of events to indicate
this.

The votes will include be a Borsh-serialization of something like the
following:

``` rust
/// This struct will be created and signed over by each
/// consensus validator, to be included as a vote extension at the end of a
/// Tendermint PreCommit phase or as Protocol Tx.
pub struct Vext {
    /// The block height for which this [`Vext`] was made.
    pub block_height: BlockHeight,
    /// The address of the signing validator
    pub validator_addr: Address,
    /// The new ethereum events seen. These should be
    /// deterministically ordered.
    pub ethereum_events: Vec<EthereumEvent>,
}
```

These votes will be delivered to subsequent block proposers who will
aggregate those that they can verify and will inject them into their
proposal. With ABCI++ this involves creating a new protocol transaction,
dubbed a _digest_, comprised of multiple individual votes on Ethereum
events.

Validators will check the validity of Ethereum events vote extensions as
part of `ProcessProposal`. This includes checking, among other things:

-   The height within the vote extension is correct (e.g. not ahead of
    the last block height). If vote extensions are supported, it is also
    checked that each vote extension came from the previous height.
    Signing over the block height also acts as a replay protection
    mechanism.
-   That signatures come from consensus validators, at the epoch the
    vote extensions originated from.
-   The bridge was active when the extension was signed.
-   Ethereum event nonces, to reject attempts to replay transactions
    through the bridge.

Furthermore, with ABCI++ enabled, the vote extensions included by the
block proposer should have a quorum of the total voting power of the
epoch of the block height behind it. Otherwise the block proposer would
not have passed the `FinalizeBlock` phase of the last round of the last
block.

These checks are to prevent censorship of events from validators by the
block proposer. If ABCI++ is not enabled, unfortunately these checks
cannot be made.

In `FinalizeBlock`, Namada derives a second transaction (the "state update"
transaction) from the vote aggregation that:

-   Calculates the required changes to `/eth_msgs` storage and applies
    them.
-   Acts on any `/eth_msgs/$msg_hash` where `seen` is going from `false`
    to `true` (e.g. appropriately minting wrapped Ethereum assets).

This state update transaction will not be recorded on chain but will be
deterministically derived from the protocol transaction including the
aggregation of votes, which is recorded on chain. All ledger nodes will
derive and apply the appropriate state changes to their own local
blockchain storage.

The value of `/eth_msgs/$msg_hash/seen` will also indicate if the event
has been acted upon on the Namada side. The appropriate transfers of
tokens to the given user will be included on chain free of charge and
requires no additional actions from the end user.
