# Modules

Namada's features are grouped into _modules_. Each module defines:
- a validity predicate, which controls a storage sub-space in the ledger state;
- a set of data structures and a storage layout, which are used in this storage sub-space;
- a set of transactions, which allow users to take actions that change state in this storage sub-space; and, optionally
- handlers to be run on various block lifecycle events (e.g. during ABCI's `FinalizeBlock` or at the end of each epoch), which can be used to implement periodic, automated state changes (e.g. minting new tokens at the end of an epoch and distributing them to delegators)

Namada includes the following modules:

- [Multitoken](./modules/multitoken.mdx)
- [Multisignature](./modules/multisignature.mdx)
- [Proof-of-stake](./modules/proof-of-stake.mdx)
- [Multi-asset-shielded-pool (MASP)](./modules/masp.mdx)
- [Governance](./modules/governance.mdx)
- [IBC](./modules/ibc.mdx)
- [Ethereum bridge](./modules/ethereum-bridge.mdx)
