# Base ledger

The base ledger of Namada includes:
- a [consensus mechanism](./base-ledger/consensus.mdx), which provides an algorithmic way for validators to communicate votes and collectively agree on a single, consistent state in a Byzantine-fault-tolerant manner;
- a validity-predicate-based [execution model](./base-ledger/execution.mdx) where a "valid state" is defined as that which satisfies a set of boolean conditions;
- a [replay protection system](./base-ledger/replay-protection.mdx) which prevents transactions from being executed multiple times;
- a [block space allocator](./base-ledger/block-space-allocator.mdx) which packs transactions into blocks; and
- a [fee system](./base-ledger/fee-system.mdx) which provides for efficient, DoS-resistant allocation of computational and storage resources within blocks
