# Replay Protection

Replay protection is a mechanism to prevent _replay attacks_, which consist of a
malicious user resubmitting an already executed transaction (often shortened to
"tx" in this document) to the ledger.

A replay attack causes the state of the machine to deviate from the intended one
(from the perspective of the parties involved in the original transaction) and
causes economic damage to the fee payer of the original transaction, who finds
themselves paying more than once. Further economic damage is caused if the
transaction involved the moving of value in some form (e.g. a transfer of
tokens) with the sender being deprived of more value than intended.

Since the original transaction was already well formatted for the protocol's
rules, the attacker doesn't need to rework it, making this attack relatively
easy.

Of course, a replay attack makes sense only if the attacker differs from the
_source_ of the original transaction, as a user will always be able to generate
another semantically identical transaction to submit without the need to replay
the same one.

To prevent this scenario, Namada supports a replay protection mechanism to
prevent the execution of already processed transactions.

## Context

This section illustrates the pre-existing context in the replay protection mechanism is implemented.

### Encryption-Authentication

The current implementation of Namada is built on top of CometBFT which
provides an encrypted and authenticated communication channel between every two
nodes to prevent a _man-in-the-middle_ attack (see the detailed {/* TODO: Fix link to be cometbft is possible*/}
[spec](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/blob/main/spec/p2p/legacy-docs/peer.md)).

The Namada protocol relies on this substrate to exchange transactions (messages)
that defines the state transition of the ledger. More specifically, a
transaction is composed of two parts: a `WrapperTx` and an inner `Tx`

{/* TODO: Check that this is up to date. I believe it is not */}
```rust
pub struct WrapperTx {
  /// The fee to be paid for including the tx
  pub fee: Fee,
  /// Used to determine an implicit account of the fee payer
  pub pk: common::PublicKey,
  /// The epoch in which the tx is to be submitted. This determines
  /// which decryption key will be used
  pub epoch: Epoch,
  /// Max amount of gas that can be used when executing the inner tx
  pub gas_limit: GasLimit,
  /// The optional unshielding tx for fee payment
  pub unshield: Option<Tx>,
  /// the encrypted payload
  pub inner_tx: EncryptedTx,
  /// sha-2 hash of the inner transaction acting as a commitment
  /// the contents of the encrypted payload
  pub tx_hash: Hash,
}

pub struct Tx {
  pub code: Vec<u8>,
  pub data: Option<Vec<u8>>,
  pub timestamp: DateTimeUtc,
}
```

The wrapper transaction is composed of some metadata, an optional unshielding tx
for fee payment (see [fee specs](./fee-system.mdx)), the encrypted
inner transaction itself and the hash of the concatenation of these values. {/* TODO: Ensure that the hash of concatenation statement is as accurate as possible. It could be values, it could be the object (which consists of keys + values)*/}
The inner `Tx` transaction carries the Wasm code to be executed and the associated data.

A transaction is constructed as follows:

1. The struct `Tx` is produced
2. The hash of this transaction gets signed by the author, producing another
   `Tx` where the data field holds the concatenation of the original data and
   the signature (`SignedTxData`)
3. The produced transaction is encrypted and embedded in a `WrapperTx`. The
   encryption step exists for a future implementation of threshold decryption
   scheme (see [Ferveo](https://github.com/anoma/ferveo))
4. Finally, the `WrapperTx` is converted to a `Tx` struct, signed over its
   hash (same as step 2, relying on `SignedTxData`), and submitted to the
   network

Note that the signer of the `WrapperTx` and that of the inner one don't need to
coincide, but the signer of the wrapper is charged with gas and fees. In
the execution steps:

1. The `WrapperTx` signature is verified and, only if valid, the tx is processed
2. In the following height the proposer decrypts the inner tx, checks that the
   hash matches that of the `tx_hash` field and, if everything went well,
   includes the decrypted tx in the proposed block
3. The inner tx will then be executed by the WASM runtime
4. After the execution, the affected validity predicates (also mentioned as VPs
   in this document) will check the storage changes and (if relevant) the
   signature of the transaction: if the signature is not valid, the VP will deem
   the transaction invalid and the changes won't be applied to the storage

The transaction data is effectively prevented from being tampered with by the signature checks, since any such tampering would cause the checks to fail and the transaction to be rejected.

[Namada execution spec](./execution.mdx).

### CometBFT replay protection

A first layer of protection is provided in the mempool of the underlying consensus engine, 
[CometBFT](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/blob/main/spec/abci/abci%2B%2B_app_requirements.md#connection-state),
which is based on a cache of transactions previously seen. This mechanism is aimed at preventing an already processed transaction from being included in the next block by a block proposer, which can occur when the transaction is received late. Of course, this also acts as a countermeasure against intentional replay attacks. However, this check, like all the checks performed in CheckTx, is weak, as a block containing invalid transactions could still be proposed by a malicious validator. Therefore, there is a need for a more robust replay protection mechanism implemented directly in the application.

## Implementation

Namada replay protection consists of three parts: the hash-based solution for both `EncryptedTx` (also referred to as the `InnerTx`) and `WrapperTx`, a way to mitigate replay attacks in case of a fork, and a concept of a lifetime for transactions.

### Hash register

The actual Wasm code and data for the transaction are encapsulated inside a
struct `Tx`, which gets encrypted as an `EncryptedTx` and wrapped inside a
`WrapperTx` (see the [relative](#encryption-authentication) section). This inner
transaction must be protected from replay attacks because it carries the actual
semantics of the state transition. This inner transaction must be protected from replay attacks, as it carries the actual semantics of the state transition. Furthermore, even if the wrapper transaction were protected from replay attacks, the inner transaction could still be extracted by an attacker, rewrapped, and replayed. It should be noted that for this attack to succeed, the attacker would need to sign the outer transaction themselves and pay gas and fees for it. However, this could still cause significant damage to the parties involved in the inner transaction.

`WrapperTx` is the only type of transaction currently accepted by the ledger. It must be protected from replay attacks; otherwise, a malicious user could replay the transaction as is. Even if the inner transaction implemented replay protection or was not accepted for any reason, the signer of the wrapper would still incur gas and fees, resulting in economic damage.

To prevent the replay of both these transactions, reliance is placed on a set of digests from already processed transactions that are kept in storage. These digests are computed on the **unsigned** transactions, to support replay
protection even for [multisigned](../modules/multisignature.mdx) transactions. In this case, using hashes from the signed transactions would result in a different hash for a different set of signatures on the same transaction, allowing for a replay. To achieve this, the `WrapperTx` hash field contains the hash of the unsigned inner transaction, instead of the signed one. This change does not impact the overall safety of Namada, as the wrapper is still signed over all its bytes, including the inner signature. The modification also allows for early replay attack checks in the mempool and during wrapper block-inclusion.

In addition, a subspace in storage is required, headed by a `ReplayProtection` internal address:
``` bash
/\$ReplayProtectionAddress/\$tx0_hash: None
/\$ReplayProtectionAddress/\$tx1_hash: None
/\$ReplayProtectionAddress/\$tx2_hash: None
...
```

The hashes are positioned at the end of the path to enable rapid storage lookups.

The consistency of the storage subspace is critically important for the correct functioning of the replay protection mechanism. To safeguard it, a validity predicate will verify that no changes to this subspace are applied by any wasm transaction, as these changes should only originate from the protocol.

In both `mempool_validation` and `process_proposal` a check is performed
(in conjunction with other checks, as described in the [relative section](#wrapper-checks)) on the digests against the storage to ensure that neither of the transactions has already been executed. If this condition is not met, the `WrapperTx` is not included in the mempool or block, respectively. In `process_proposal` a
temporary cache is used to prevent the replay of a transaction in the same block. If both
checks pass, the transaction is included in the block. The hashes are
committed to storage in `finalize_block` and the transaction is executed.

In the subsequent block, the inner transaction is deserialized, and the validity of the decrypted transactions and their correct order are verified. If the order is incorrect, a new round of CometBFT commences. If an error is found in any individual decrypted transaction, the previously inserted hash of the inner transaction is removed from storage to allow for rewrapping, and the transaction itself is discarded. Finally, in `finalize_block` the transaction is executed. If the transaction runs out of gas, its hash will be removed from storage to enable rewrapping and execution of the transaction. Otherwise, the hash will remain in storage, regardless of the success or failure of the transaction.

#### Optional unshielding

The optional `unshield` field is supposed to carry an unshielding masp
`Transaction`. Given this assumption, there's no need to manage it since masp
has an internal replay protection mechanism.

Still, since this field represents a valid, `Transaction`, there is a possible
attack that can be run by leveraging this field: a malicious user could extract
this data before it makes it to a block, embed it into a valid, masp signed
`Tx` and apply it in advance.

This attack is performed before the original tx is placed in a block and,
therefore, cannot be prevented with a replay protection mechanism. The only
result of this attack would be that the original wrapper transaction would fail
since it would attempt to replay a masp transfer: in this case, the submitter of
the original tx can recreate it without the need for the unshielding operation
since the attacker has already performed it.

Given that saving the hash of the unshielding transaction is redundant in case
of a proper masp transfer, Namada does not implement the replay protection
mechanism on the unshielding transaction, whose correctness is left to the masp
validity predicate. The combination of the fee system, the validity predicates
set and the protocol checks on the unshielding operation guarantees that even if
the attack explained in this section is performed:

- The original wrapper signer doesn't suffer economic damage (the wrapper
  containing the invalid unshielding forces the block rejection without fee
  collection)
- The attacker has to pay fees on the rewrapped tx preventing him to submit
  these transactions for free

#### Governance proposals

Governance [proposals](../modules/governance.mdx) may carry some wasm code to
be executed in case the proposal passed. This code is embedded into a
`DecryptedTx` directly by the validators at block processing time and is not
inserted into the block itself.

Given that the wasm code is attached to the transaction initiating the proposal,
it could be extracted from here and inserted in a transaction before the
proposal is executed. Therefore, replay protection is not a solution to prevent
attacks on governance proposals' code. Instead, to protect these transactions,
Namada relies on its proposal id mechanism in conjunction with the VP set.

#### Protocol transactions

At the moment, protocol transactions are only used for ETH bridge related
operations. The current implementation already takes care of replay attempts by
keeping track of the validators' signature on the events: this also includes
replay attacks in the same block.

In the future, new types of protocol transactions may be supported: in this
case, a review of the replay protection mechanism might be required.

### Forks

In the case of a fork, replay attacks are not prevented by the transaction hash alone. Transactions could still be replayed on the other branch as long as their format remains unchanged and the counters in storage match.

To mitigate this problem, transactions need to carry a `ChainId` identifier
to tie them to a specific fork. This field must be added to the `Tx` struct
so that it applies to both `WrapperTx` and `EncryptedTx`:

```rust
pub struct Tx {
  pub code: Vec<u8>,
  pub data: Option<Vec<u8>>,
  pub timestamp: DateTimeUtc,
  pub chain_id: ChainId
}
```

This new field is signed just like the other ones and is therefore subject to the same guarantees explained in the [initial](#encryption-authentication) section. The validity of this identifier is checked in `process_proposal`
for both the outer and inner tx: for both the outer and inner transactions. If a transaction carries an unexpected chain id, it won't be applied, meaning that no modifications will be applied to storage.

### Transaction lifetime

In general, a transaction is valid at the moment of submission, but after that, various external factors (ledger state, etc.) might change the submitter's intent. The submitter may no longer be interested in the execution of the transaction.

The concept of a lifetime (or timeout) for transactions needs to be introduced: the `Tx` struct will include an optional additional field called `expiration`, indicating the maximum `DateTimeUtc` by which the submitter is willing to see the transaction executed. After the specified time, the transaction is considered invalid and discarded, irrespective of other checks.

By introducing this new field, a new constraint is added to the transaction's contract. The ledger ensures that the transaction is prevented from execution after the deadline. On the other hand, the submitter commits to the execution outcome until its expiration. If the expiration is reached and the transaction has not been executed, the submitter can decide to submit a new transaction if still interested in the changes carried by it.

In the current design, the `expiration` holds until the transaction is executed. Once executed, the transaction hash is committed to storage, preventing further replays (regardless of whether the tx was successful or not). Essentially, the transaction submitter commits to one of these three conditions:

- Transaction is invalid regardless of the specific state
- Transaction is executed (either with success or not) and the transaction hash
  is saved in the storage
- Expiration time has passed

Any satisfied condition invalidates further executions of the same transaction.

```rust
pub struct Tx {
  pub code: Vec<u8>,
  pub data: Option<Vec<u8>>,
  pub timestamp: DateTimeUtc,
  pub chain_id: ChainId,
  /// Optional lifetime of the transaction
  pub expiration: Option<DateTimeUtc>,
}
```

The wrapper transaction must match the `expiration` of the inner transaction (if any). This field is also needed for the wrapper to anticipate the check at mempool/proposal evaluation time. Additionally, it prevents someone from inserting a wrapper transaction after the corresponding inner transaction has expired, compelling the wrapper signer to pay the fees.

### Wrapper checks

In mempool_validation, several checks are performed on the wrapper transaction to validate it. These checks include:

- Signature
- GasLimit is below the block gas limit
- Fees are paid with an accepted token and match the minimum required amount
- ChainId
- Transaction hash
- Expiration
- Sufficient funds for wrapper signer to pay the fee
- Unshielding transaction (if present) is a valid masp unshielding transfer
- Unshielding transaction (if present) releases the minimum required tokens for fee payment
- Successful execution of the unshielding transaction (if present)

More details about gas, fees, and the unshielding transaction can be found in the [fee specs](./fee-system.mdx).

These checks can all be conducted before executing the transactions themselves. If any of these checks fail, the transaction is considered invalid, and the appropriate action is taken:

1. If the checks fail for signature, chainId, expiration, transaction hash, balance, or the unshielding transaction, the transaction is permanently invalid. It does not need to be included in the block. Furthermore, including the transaction in the block to impose a fee (as a form of punishment) is not possible, as these errors may not be due to the signer of the transaction (could be caused by malicious users or simply delayed transaction inclusion in the block).
2. If the checks fail for `Fee` or `GasLimit`, the transaction is discarded. In theory, the gas limit of a block is a Namada parameter governed by governance. Thus, the transaction could become valid in the future if this limit is increased. The same principle applies to the token whitelist and the minimum required fee. However, these parameters are expected to change slowly, so rejecting the transaction is reasonable (the submitter can always resubmit it in the future).

If all checks pass validation, the transaction is included in the block to store the hash and apply the fee.

All of these checks are also run in `process_proposal`.

This mechanism can also be applied to another scenario. Suppose a transaction was not propagated to the network by a node (or a group of colluding nodes). This transaction might be valid, but it is not inserted into a block. Without an expiration, this transaction could be replayed (more accurately, applied, as it was never executed in the first place) at a later time when the submitter may no longer wish to execute it.

### Block rejection

To prevent the inclusion of invalid transactions in a block by a block proposer, the validators reject the entire block if they encounter a single invalid wrapper transaction.

Rejecting only the single invalid transaction while still allowing the acceptance of the entire block constitutes an inadequate solution. In this scenario, the block proposer lacks the motivation to incorporate invalid transactions into the block, as these do not yield any fees. However, simultaneously, there exists no real disincentive for the proposer to exclude such transactions. In such cases, validators simply discard the invalid transaction while approving the remainder of the block, thereby enabling the proposer to collect fees from all other transactions. This circumstance applies, of course, when the proposer lacks other valid transactions to include. A malicious proposer could employ this strategy to inundate the block with spam without facing any penalties.

In summary, a block faces rejection if at least one of the following conditions is satisfied:

- One or more `WrapperTx` transactions are invalid in accordance with the checks delineated in the
  [relative section](#wrapper-checks)
- The order or number of decrypted transactions differs from the order or number committed in the previous block
