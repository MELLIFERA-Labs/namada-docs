# Consensus

Namada uses [CometBFT](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/) (nee Tendermint Go) through the [cometbft-rs](https://github.com/heliaxdev/tendermint-rs) (nee tendermint-rs) bindings in order to provide peer-to-peer transaction gossip, Byzantine fault tolerant (BFT) consensus, and state machine replication for Namada's custom state machine. CometBFT implements the Tendermint consensus algorithm, which you can read more about [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.04938).

## The benefits of using CometBFT

CometBFT, coupled with a cryptoeconomic voting power allocation mechanism called "proof of stake", is designed so that that non-colluding validators acting in their (economic) self interest will follow the consensus algorithm in a predictable manner.

Using the CometBFT consensus algorithm comes with a number of benefits including:

- Fast finality 
    - CometBFT achieves fast and deterministic finality, meaning that once a block is committed to the blockchain, it is irreversible. This is crucial for applications which rely on settled transactions that cannot be rolled back, and enables efficient, low-latency interoperability.
- Inter-blockchain communication system (IBC)
    - Interoperability with all other IBC-supporting chains, such as [Osmosis](https://osmosis.zone), the [Cosmos Hub](https://cosmos.network), and [Noble](https://nobleassets.xyz/).
- Battle tested
    - The entire Cosmos ecosystem has been using CometBFT (nee Tendermint) for years.
- Customisable
    - Allows the configuration of various parameters, including the ability to implement a custom proof of stake algorithm (as Namada does).
