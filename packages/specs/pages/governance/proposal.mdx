# Namada Proposals

## Proposal JSON
Field semantics are as follows:

- The `content` value should follow a standard format. 
We leverage a similar format to what is described in the [BIP2](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0002.mediawiki#bip-format-and-structure) document:

```json
{
    "title": "<text>",
    "authors": "<authors' email addresses> ",
    "discussions-to": "<email address / link>",
    "created": "<date created on, in ISO 8601 (yyyy-mm-dd) format>",
    "license": "<abbreviation for approved license(s)>",
    "abstract": "<text>",
    "motivation": "<text>",
    "details": "<Proposal Number> - optional field",
    "requires": "<proposal id of any proposals that need to occur before this proposal can be implemented> -optional field",
}
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="">
    The proposal number is different from the proposal id. The id is a counter that does not include offline proposals. The proposal number is a counter that includes offline proposals. 
    The proposal id is a unique identifier that is assigned to each proposal when it is submitted. The proposal id is used to reference a proposal in the Namada blockchain.
</Callout>

The `Author` address field will be used to credit the locked funds if the proposal is approved.
The `ProposalType` imply different combinations of:
    - the optional wasm code attached to the proposal
    - which actors should be allowed to vote (delegators and validators or validators only)
    - the threshold to be used in the tally process
    - the optional payload (memo) attached to the vote

## Supported proposal types

At the moment, Namada supports 3 types of governance proposals:

```rust
pub enum ProposalType {
  /// Carries the optional proposal code path
  Default(Option<String>),
  StewardProposal,
  PGFProposal,
}
```

`Default` represents a generic proposal with the following properties:

- Can carry a WASM code to be executed in case the proposal passes
- Allows both validators and delegators to vote
- Requires $\frac{2}{3}$ of the total voting power to succeed
- Doesn't expect any memo attached to the votes

`StewardProposal` is a proposal to change the StewardSet for _Public Goods Funding_:
- Doesn't carry any WASM code
- Allows both validators and delegators to vote
- Requires $\frac{1}{3}$ of the total voting power to vote
- Requires $\frac{1}{2}$ of the non-abstain (either yea or nay) votes to be `Yay`

`PGFProposal` is a proposal to *conduct* _Public Goods Funding_:
- Doesn't carry any WASM code
- Allows both validators and delegators to vote
- Has different properties depending on whether or not the submitter is a steward
If the proposer is not a steward:
- Requires $\frac{1}{3}$ of the total voting power to vote
- Requires $\frac{1}{2}$ of the non-abstain votes to be `Yay`
If the proposer is a steward, passes unless:
- $\frac{1}{3}$ of the total voting power votes on the proposal, **AND** out of the votes, at least $\frac{1}{2}$ of the non-abstain votes are `Nay`
- Causes the steward to lose steward status if $\frac{2}{3}$ of the total voting power votes on the proposal **AND** out of the votes, at least $\frac{2}{3}$ of the non-abstain votes are `Nay`
